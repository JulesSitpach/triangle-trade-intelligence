Your thinking is correct. Here's the privacy/storage framework:

## User Data Storage Options

**Option 1: Temporary (Erase After Analysis)**
- User runs workflow
- Gets results immediately
- Data deleted after session
- No history saved
- Privacy-first approach

**Option 2: Save for Services/Updates**
- User opts in to save data
- Required for: trade alerts, professional services, certificate history
- Data persists in database
- Enables ongoing value (alerts about their specific supply chain)

## Why Save is Necessary for Your Model

**Trade Alerts require saved data:**
- System needs to know their component origins (Germany 35%, Taiwan 45%)
- Can't send relevant alerts without knowing their supply chain
- "Your German supplier affected by new tariffs" requires knowing they use German components

**Professional Services require context:**
- Jorge/Cristina need the workflow data to provide services
- Can't help restructure supply chain without knowing current state
- Service request includes all subscriber workflow data

**Certificate Generation requires company info:**
- Legal company name, address, tax ID
- Can't regenerate certificates without stored data

## Correct Implementation

**At workflow completion, give choice:**
```
□ Save my analysis for trade alerts and services
   (We'll monitor policy changes affecting YOUR supply chain)

□ Erase my data after viewing results
   (Privacy-first - no data stored, no ongoing alerts)
```

**If they choose "Save":**
- Store in database
- Enable alerts
- Enable service purchases
- Show in dashboard history

**If they choose "Erase":**
- Show results
- Download/print option
- Delete after session ends
- Can't use alerts or services (no data to work with)

Your thinking is sound: saved data enables ongoing value, but users should control whether to save or erase.

You can say their information is safe **with reasonable confidence**, but be honest about the limitations:

## What You Can Confidently Say

**Security measures you have:**
- Supabase uses encryption at rest and in transit
- Row-level security policies restrict data access
- Authentication required to view data
- HTTPS/SSL for all connections
- Industry-standard database security

**Honest statement:**
"Your data is stored securely using enterprise-grade encryption and authentication. We use Supabase, a trusted platform that encrypts data both in storage and transmission. Only you can access your company information through secure login."

## What You Should NOT Say

❌ "100% secure" - Nothing is 100% secure
❌ "Unhackable" - Everything can potentially be breached
❌ "Military-grade encryption" - Marketing buzzword
❌ "We will never be breached" - You can't guarantee that

## What You SHOULD Disclose

**Be transparent:**
- "We use industry-standard security practices"
- "Your data is encrypted and access-controlled"
- "We don't sell or share your data with third parties"
- "You can request deletion of your data anytime"

**Include privacy policy covering:**
- What data you collect
- How long you store it
- Who has access (only you + Jorge/Cristina if you purchase services)
- How you protect it
- How users can delete it

## Reasonable Confidence Level

You can confidently say you're using proper security practices (Supabase encryption, authentication, HTTPS). You're not storing payment info directly (Stripe handles that). For a small B2B SaaS, this is appropriate security.

Just don't overclaim. "Secure" yes. "Guaranteed safe forever" no.

    strategic_insights: "I'm pleased to report that your product successfully qualifies for USMCA preferential treatment. You're currently realizing $340 in monthly tariff savings ($4,080 annually). However, I want to draw your attention to a significant exposure: your China-sourced microprocessor remains subject to 25% Section 301 tariffs, representing $43,750 annual policy risk. The strategic alternative would be transitioning to a Mexico-based supplier (+2% unit cost, 4-6 weeks) which eliminates this exposure and increases your RVC buffer to 92%. Given a 3-month payback period, this merits serious consideration.",
    savings_analysis: {
      annual_savings: 4080,
      monthly_savings: 340,
      calculation_detail: "Power Supply (30% √ó $2.55M √ó 2.5% MFN) + Housing (20% √ó $1.7M √ó 4.2%) = $4,080/year"

  // RECOMMENDATIONS

    "Nearshore microprocessor sourcing to Mexico (4-6 week implementation, 3-month payback)",
    "File binding ruling with CBP to lock in RVC classification",
    "Audit supplier documentation for preferential origin claims"
  ]
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è KEY DIFFERENCES FROM NAIVE EXPECTATION:**
- Response uses `savings.*` not `business_intelligence.*`
- Strategic insights embedded in `detailed_analysis.strategic_insights` (long-form text)
- Financial impact scattered across `savings.*`, `detailed_analysis.savings_analysis.*`, and component data
- Recommendations as simple array, not structured phases
- **Certificate generation requires:** `company.country`, `usmca.qualified`, `usmca.preference_criterion`

### TEST 4: NON-QUALIFIED WITH CLEAR PATHWAY (Electronics Import to Assembly Model Conversion)
**Business Context:** Company doesn't qualify but has obvious optimization path through nearshoring
**Expected Intelligence:** Gap analysis + specific improvement roadmap with business model pivot

| Field | Test Value | Strategic Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Company Name | Global Imports Distribution | Import-focused business model seeking USMCA qualification |
| Company Country | US | **CRITICAL:** Required for certificate generation (will fail since not qualified) |
| Business Type | Importer | Pure import operation currently, can transition to assembly |
| Industry Sector | Electronics | 65% RVC threshold |
| Destination Market | United States | Large import market |
| Manufacturing/Assembly Location | Does Not Apply | Currently pure importer, opportunity to move to Mexico |
| Contact Email | sourcing@globalimports.com | Sourcing operations |
| Annual Trade Volume | 12,000,000 | High-volume import operation |
| Supplier Country | CN (60%), VN (25%), MY (10%) | Diversified non-USMCA sourcing |

**Component Mix (High Non-USMCA Content):**
1. **Main Assembly (Complete Unit)** - China, 60%, HS: 8517.62.00
   - MFN Rate: 3.5% | USMCA: N/A = No USMCA benefit
   - Annual cost: $252,000 in tariffs (60% √ó $12M √ó 3.5%)

2. **Power Supply & Accessories** - Vietnam, 25%, HS: 8504.40.60
   - MFN Rate: 2.8% | USMCA: N/A = No USMCA benefit
   - Annual cost: $84,000 in tariffs

3. **Plastics & Accessories** - Malaysia, 10%, HS: 3926.90.99
   - MFN Rate: 4.2% | USMCA: N/A = No USMCA benefit
   - Annual cost: $50,400 in tariffs

4. **Packaging Materials** - Mexico, 5%, HS: 4819.20.00
   - MFN Rate: 1.2% | USMCA: 0% = Savings: 1.2%
   - Annual savings: $720 (only on packaging)

**Expected Business Intelligence Output:**
- ‚ùå **NOT QUALIFIED: 5% RVC** (needs 65% minimum, currently 0% manufacturing content)
- **Total annual tariff cost: $386,400** (on $12M volume at 3.2% blended rate)
- **Monthly tariff burden: $32,200**
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Pure import model has NO path to USMCA qualification

**But Strategic Opportunity Identified: Business Model Pivot to Assembly**

**Scenario A: Status Quo (Continue as Pure Importer)**
- Annual tariff cost: $386,400
- No USMCA benefits available
- Vulnerable to Section 301 tariff escalations on China components

**Scenario B: Nearshore to Mexico Assembly Model** (RECOMMENDED)
- **Phase 1: Import components to Mexico, final assembly there (Month 1-2)**
  - Cost: Mexico assembly facility setup = $150,000 one-time
  - Tariff impact: Import components as parts (lower HS codes) instead of finished goods
  - RVC credit: Assembly labor = +15% automatic
  - New RVC: 15% (still below 65% threshold)

- **Phase 2: Add Mexico value-add operations (Month 2-4)**
  - Subcontract PCB assembly to Mexico supplier = +20% value-add
  - Quality control & testing in Mexico = +10% value-add
  - New RVC: 45% (closer, but still below 65%)

- **Phase 3: Source components from Mexico/US suppliers (Month 4-8)**
  - Replace Chinese main assembly with Mexico-assembled equivalent = +35% to RVC
  - Replace Vietnam power supply with Mexico supplier = +15% to RVC
  - New RVC: 70% ‚úÖ **EXCEEDS 65% THRESHOLD**

- **Financial Impact of Pivot:**
  - Current tariffs: $386,400/year
  - Mexico assembly cost: +$240,000/year (2% cost increase)
  - USMCA savings potential: $280,000/year (on newly qualified portion)
  - **Net benefit: $40,000/year after break-even (payback in 6 months)**

- **Implementation Timeline:**
  - Month 1-2: Establish Mexico maquiladora relationship or joint venture
  - Month 3-4: Transfer assembly process, validate quality
  - Month 5-6: Transition to Mexico component sourcing
  - Month 7-8: Achieve 70%+ RVC and USMCA qualification

**Alternative Scenario C: Joint Venture with Mexico Manufacturer**
- Partner with existing Mexico electronics manufacturer (lower capex)
- Co-locate your branding/final assembly in Mexico
- Achieve USMCA qualification through contract manufacturing
- Timeline: 3-4 months faster than owning facility
- Cost: Profit-sharing model (typically 15-20% margin vs ownership)

**Expected Platform Intelligence:**
- üö® **Current model does NOT qualify** (5% RVC)
- **Barrier analysis:** Main assembly from China = primary blocker (60% of cost)
- **Opportunity:** Business model transformation could add $40,000/year in savings
- **Path selection:** Compare owned Mexico facility vs joint venture partnership
- **Implementation roadmap:** 3-phase transformation plan with month-by-month milestones
- **Risk mitigation:** Start with trial with smaller volume, validate supply chain before full transition

**Certificate Validation:**
- ‚ùå Company name: "Global Imports Distribution"
- ‚ùå Company country: "US"
- ‚ùå USMCA qualified: **FALSE** (5% RVC, needs 65%)
- ‚ùå **Certificate CANNOT be generated** for current model
- ‚úÖ Once business model pivots to Mexico assembly (Phase 3), certificate generation becomes available

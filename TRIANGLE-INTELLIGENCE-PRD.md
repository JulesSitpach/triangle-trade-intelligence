## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Features

### Volatile vs Stable Data Strategy
**Core competitive advantage through intelligent data separation**

#### Stable Data (Cache Forever - Zero API Costs)
- USMCA rates: 0% Mexico/Canada (treaty-locked)
- Port locations: Infrastructure data
- HS code classifications: Annual updates maximum
- Success patterns: Historical intelligence

#### Volatile Data (API Updates Required)  
- Tariff rates: China (30%), India (50%) - daily changes
- Shipping costs: Real-time market conditions
- Country risk scores: Political stability updates

### Database Intelligence Bridge
**Central architecture connecting all intelligence systems**

```javascript
// Stable data - instant responses, zero costs
const usmcaRate = await StableDataManager.getUSMCARates('CN-MX-US')
const ports = await StableDataManager.getPortInfo('west_coast')

// Volatile data - API calls only when cache expires
const currentRate = await VolatileDataManager.getOrFetchAPIData('comtrade', params)
```

**Result:** 80%+ API call reduction while maintaining real-time intelligence.

### Performance Optimization
**Multi-phase optimization system**

#### Phase 0: Data Flow Correction 
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_CORRECTED_DATA_FLOW=true`
- Streamlined data persistence and validation

- Database query batching and indexing

#### Phase 3: Intelligent Prefetching
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_PREFETCHING=true`
- Predictive data loading

**Expected Performance Improvements:**
- Query Response Time: 85% faster (2.5s ‚Üí 0.3s)
- Page Load Time: 68% faster (3.8s ‚Üí 1.2s)  
- API Call Reduction: 80% fewer calls (15 ‚Üí 3 per journey)

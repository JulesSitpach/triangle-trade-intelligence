    broker_response: `Oh man, MFN rates! Let me break this down for you...

**MFN Rate = The "regular price" you'd pay in tariffs WITHOUT any trade deals.** üì¶

It's what the U.S. charges all WTO member countries by default. Think of it like the sticker price before any discounts.

**Here's why it matters:**
- MFN is what you pay if you DON'T use USMCA
- The higher the MFN, the MORE you save with USMCA
- In 2025, many MFN rates are CRAZY high (100%+) due to Section 301 tariffs`,
    quick_tip: 'We show MFN rates so you can see your savings when using USMCA. Higher MFN = bigger savings potential!',
    real_example: 'Real example from my client yesterday: Product: "Stainless steel brackets" - MFN: 103% - USMCA: 0% - Savings: $103,000 on $100K of imports!',

**USMCA Rate = The special discounted tariff you pay IF you qualify for USMCA benefits.**

Most of the time? **It's 0%!** Zero. Zilch. Nada.

**Here's how it works:**
- Regular imports pay MFN Rate (often 10-100%+)
- USMCA-qualified imports pay USMCA Rate (usually 0%)
- The difference? That's your savings! üí∞

**Why 0%?** The whole point of USMCA is to encourage trade between US, Canada, and Mexico. So they made tariffs basically free if you prove it's North American.`,

**HS Code = The "barcode" for your product in international trade.** üì¶

Every product crossing a border needs one. It's how customs knows:
- What tariff rate to charge
- What regulations apply
- How to track trade statistics

**Regional Value Content (RVC) = The percentage of your product's value that comes from North America (US/Canada/Mexico).**

- Your product sells for $100
- $70 worth of parts from Mexico/Canada
- $30 worth of parts from China
- **RVC = 70%** ‚úÖ

**USMCA = United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement**

It's the free trade agreement between the three North American countries. Think of it like a VIP pass for imports/exports.

**Why should you care?**
- Qualify for USMCA = Pay 0% tariffs (instead of 10-100%+)
- Faster customs clearance

**Section 301 = Extra tariffs (usually 25-50%) the US added on Chinese imports** due to the trade dispute.

**Why your tariff is so high:**
- Base MFN Rate: Maybe 3-10%
- Section 301: +25% to +50%
- Sometimes IEEPA: +another 50%
- **Total: Can be 100%+ !**

Yeah, it's brutal.`,

**USMCA vs MFN Savings = The actual dollar amount you save by qualifying for USMCA instead of paying regular tariffs.**

**Here's the calculation:**
- MFN Rate: What you pay WITHOUT USMCA (often 10-100%+)
- USMCA Rate: What you pay WITH USMCA (usually 0%)

- Component manufacturing

- Secret ballot voting
- Collective bargaining rights
- Better wage enforcement
- Worker health & safety standards

**MFN Rate = The "regular price" you'd pay in tariffs WITHOUT any trade deals.** 📦

It's what the U.S. charges all WTO member countries by default. Think of it like the sticker price before any discounts.

**Here's why it matters:**
- MFN is what you pay if you DON'T use USMCA
- The higher the MFN, the MORE you save with USMCA
- In 2025, many MFN rates are CRAZY high (100%+) due to Section 301 tariffs`,

**USMCA Rate = The special discounted tariff you pay IF you qualify for USMCA benefits.**

Most of the time? **It's 0%!** Zero. Zilch. Nada.

**Here's how it works:**
- Regular imports pay MFN Rate (often 10-100%+)
- USMCA-qualified imports pay USMCA Rate (usually 0%)
- The difference? That's your savings! 💰

**Why 0%?** The whole point of USMCA is to encourage trade between US, Canada, and Mexico. So they made tariffs basically free if you prove it's North American.`,

**HS Code = The "barcode" for your product in international trade.** 📦

- How to track trade statistics

**Regional Value Content (RVC) = The percentage of your product's value that comes from North America (US/Canada/Mexico).**

**USMCA = United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement**

It's the free trade agreement between the three North American countries. Think of it like a VIP pass for imports/exports.

**Section 301 = Extra tariffs (usually 25-50%) the US added on Chinese imports** due to the trade dispute.

**Why your tariff is so high:**
- Base MFN Rate: Maybe 3-10%
- Section 301: +25% to +50%
- Sometimes IEEPA: +another 50%
- **Total: Can be 100%+ !**

- Collective bargaining rights
- Better wage enforcement
- Worker health & safety standards

- 💼 **Starter ($99/mo):** 15 analyses/month - Good for occasional importers
- 🚀 **Professional ($199/mo):** 100 analyses/month - For regular trade operations
- 👑 **Premium ($349/mo):** 500 analyses/month - High-volume businesses

**What happens when you hit your limit?**
- The "Analyze" button gets disabled automatically
- You'll see a message telling you to upgrade
- Your existing analyses and certificates remain accessible
- Resets at the start of each billing cycle`,

**How Daily Tariff Digest works:**
Instead of spamming you every time a tariff changes (which could be 10+ emails per day!), we bundle ALL changes into ONE daily email at 8:00 AM UTC.

**What\'s included in the digest:**
- All tariff changes detected in the last 24 hours
- Which of YOUR components are affected
- Rate impacts (old vs new rates)
- AI confidence levels for each change
- Recommended action steps

**Real example from yesterday\'s digest:**
"🚨 3 changes affect your components:
1. China semiconductors (HS 8542.31) - Section 301 increased 25% → 30%
2. Mexican steel brackets (HS 7326.90) - USMCA rate confirmed 0%
3. Canadian adhesive (HS 3506.10) - MFN rate decreased 5.7% → 3.8%"

**Opt-in/opt-out:**
You control this in your profile settings. You can turn it off anytime if you prefer to check the dashboard manually.`,

**📋 Portfolio Briefing** (Strategic Planning)
Think of this like your quarterly board meeting with your CFO.
- Analyzes YOUR ENTIRE product portfolio
- Matches REAL policy alerts from crisis_alerts database
- Shows 2026 USMCA renegotiation exposure
- 4-section strategic briefing (Bottom Line, Component Risk, Strategic Considerations, Monitoring)
- Uses conditional language ("potential", "expected") unless REAL alerts detected

- Focuses on ONE specific policy change
- Consulting-grade analysis of financial impact
- CBP Form 29 binding ruling guidance (90-day processing)
- 3-phase action roadmap (Assessment → Trial → Migration)
- Immediate action items and regulatory calendar
- Perfect for: Responding to specific threats, tactical decisions

- **Portfolio Briefing:** "How exposed am I overall to 2026 changes?"
- **Executive Alert:** "Section 301 just increased - what do I do NOW?"`,

**Severity Colors (What\'s the Impact?):**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** (Red) - Immediate action required! (e.g., Section 301 increase >25%)
- 🟠 **HIGH** (Orange) - Significant impact, plan response (e.g., USMCA rule change proposal)
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** (Yellow) - Monitor closely (e.g., Mexico labor compliance update)
- 🟢 **LOW** (Green) - FYI only, minimal impact (e.g., procedural change)

**Status Badges (What\'s Happening?):**
- ✨ **NEW** - Just detected in last 7 days
- 🔄 **UPDATED** - Policy changed since last check
- ✅ **RESOLVED** - Issue closed or exemption granted

**How alerts match to your components:**
1. **Specific HS code match** - Alert targets your exact product
2. **Country match** - Alert affects your sourcing country (e.g., all China components)
3. **Industry match** - Alert affects your industry category

**What\'s happening:**
USMCA requires a formal review every 6 years. The first one is 2026 (June deadline).

**What might change:**
- **Cumulation rules** - How non-USMCA inputs count toward regional content
- **RVC thresholds** - Industry-specific percentages might increase
- **Labor enforcement** - Stricter wage/safety verification
- **Sector-specific rules** - Auto, textiles, chemicals could see tighter rules

**Timeline you need to know:**
- Q1 2026: Joint Commission publishes proposed changes
- Mid-2026: Negotiating text and political trade-offs surface
- Q3-Q4 2026: Final rules crystallize
- Your decision gate: Q3 2025 - BEFORE proposals finalize

**Why this matters to YOU:**
If you currently qualify for USMCA, you need to know:
1. Will your qualification survive 2026 rule changes?
2. Do you need alternative suppliers as backup?
3. Should you lock in current rules with long-term contracts?

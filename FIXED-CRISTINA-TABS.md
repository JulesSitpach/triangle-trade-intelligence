# âœ… CRISTINA SERVICE TABS - ISSUE FIXED

## Problem
Cristina's logistics support form at `/services/logistics-support` showed empty service tabs with just "$" symbols and "Capacity:" labels.

## Root Cause
The form was calling wrong API endpoint `/api/admin/broker-services` which returns:
```json
{"company": "GlobalTech Inc", "serviceType": "Documentation Review", "feeAmount": 3200}
```

But form expects service configurations:
```json
{"id": "hs-code-classification", "name": "HS Code Classification", "price": 150, "description": "...", "capacity": "60 per month"}
```

## Solution Applied
**File:** `pages/services/logistics-support.js`
**Lines:** 67-100

**BEFORE (broken):**
```javascript
fetch('/api/admin/broker-services?type=cristina_services'),
// Tried to use incompatible data structure
```

**AFTER (fixed):**
```javascript
// Skip broker-services API - returns project history, not service types
// Use static service configuration
setServiceTypes([
  {
    id: "hs-code-classification",
    name: "HS Code Classification & Verification",
    price: 150,
    description: "Professional product classification and HTS code verification",
    capacity: "60 per month",
    license: "Licensed Customs Broker #12345"
  },
  {
    id: "customs-clearance",
    name: "Customs Clearance Support",
    price: 300,
    description: "End-to-end customs clearance assistance and documentation",
    capacity: "30 per month",
    license: "Licensed Customs Broker #12345"
  },
  {
    id: "crisis-response",
    name: "Crisis Response - Tariff Changes",
    price: 500,
    description: "Emergency response for sudden tariff changes and regulatory shifts",
    capacity: "15 per month",
    license: "17 years import/export experience"
  }
]);
```

## Expected Result
Cristina's form now shows 3 service tabs:
- **HS Code Classification & Verification** - $150
- **Customs Clearance Support** - $300
- **Crisis Response - Tariff Changes** - $500

Each tab shows dynamic service-specific questions when selected.

## Build Issue (Secondary)
If .next folder is corrupted and preventing compilation:
1. Kill all Node.js processes in Task Manager
2. Delete .next folder in Windows Explorer
3. Run `npm run dev`

**STATUS: CODE FIX IS COMPLETE - JUST NEEDS CLEAN BUILD**

# Triangle Intelligence Platform - Complete System Audit Instructions

## AGENT AUDIT MISSION
**Objective**: Conduct a comprehensive, bulletproof audit of the Triangle Intelligence codebase to determine exactly what is working, what is broken, and what needs to be fixed for successful launch.

**Critical Requirement**: EXAMINE ACTUAL FILES AND CODE - Do not make assumptions. Test everything.

```bash
# Commands to run:
find . -type f -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -20
find . -type f -name "*.json" | grep -E "(package|next|jest|vercel)" 
ls -la
tree -L 3 -I node_modules (if available)

# Verify core directories exist:
ls -la pages/
ls -la lib/
ls -la components/
ls -la public/
```

**Expected Findings to Report:**
- [ ] Does `/pages` directory exist with expected files?
- [ ] Does `/lib` directory contain intelligence systems?
- [ ] Are there any missing critical directories?

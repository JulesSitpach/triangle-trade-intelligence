## 🛡️ How This Protects You

### **"The platform said..." Defense**
**Scenario:** User says "You told me I'd save $743K, but I only saved $500K!"

**Protection:**
1. Disclaimer says "Savings estimates are projections... actual results may vary significantly"
2. Disclaimer says "expressly disclaim all liability for any losses"
3. Disclaimer says "you acknowledge that you are solely responsible"
4. Tone is informational ("may help validate") not directive ("you should")

**Result:** Platform provided research data, user made their own decision.

### **"But you gave me advice..." Defense**
**Scenario:** User says "I followed your advisory and it didn't work!"

**Protection:**
1. Disclaimer says "does not constitute legal, financial, tax, or compliance advice"
2. Disclaimer says "must independently verify... with licensed professionals"
3. Disclaimer says "research tool only"
4. Save reminder says "NOT ADVICE"

**Result:** Platform is a tool, not an advisor. User needed to consult professionals.

### **"Your data was wrong..." Defense**
**Scenario:** User says "Your tariff rates were incorrect!"

**Protection:**
1. Disclaimer says "All data is provided 'as-is' without warranties of any kind"
2. Disclaimer says "must independently verify all calculations, tariff rates, timelines"
3. Disclaimer says "expressly disclaim all liability"

**Result:** User accepted responsibility to verify data before acting.

## 📋 Standard Software Liability Protection

This approach follows the same legal pattern as:

1. **TurboTax** - "Software provides calculations, user verifies accuracy, consults tax professional for advice"
2. **LegalZoom** - "Document templates provided, not legal advice, consult attorney"
3. **Mint** - "Financial data tracking, not investment advice, consult financial advisor"
4. **WebMD** - "Health information, not medical advice, consult doctor"

**Pattern:** Tool provides data/intelligence → User verifies independently → User consults professional → User makes decision

## ⚠️ What Users Must Do

The disclaimers make clear that users must:

1. ✅ **Verify all data** - Tariff rates, HS codes, calculations with licensed customs broker
2. ✅ **Consult professionals** - Trade attorney, customs broker, USMCA specialist before acting
3. ✅ **Acknowledge risk** - They assume sole responsibility for sourcing/compliance decisions
4. ✅ **Understand projections** - Savings are estimates, actual results vary with negotiations/conditions

    requested_by: 'Jorge',
    assigned_to: 'Cristina',
    priority: value > 15000 ? 'urgent' : 'high'
  });
}
```

### 4. Broker Services API
**File:** `pages/api/admin/broker-services.js`
**Purpose:** Historical broker service engagement tracking
**Data Structure:** `{company, serviceType, feeAmount, status, clientSatisfaction}`

#### Revenue Tracking:
```javascript
revenue_summary: {
  current_month: 24500,      // This month's revenue
  previous_month: 18700,     // Last month for comparison
  total_revenue: 156300,     // All-time revenue
  active_services: 12,       // Currently in progress
  completed_services: 89,    // Successfully completed
  pending_payment: 7200      // Awaiting payment
}
```

## ⚠️ Fixed Issues Documentation

### Issue 1: Empty Service Tabs (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Cristina's logistics support form at `/services/logistics-support` showed empty tabs
**Root Cause:** Form was calling `/api/admin/broker-services` which returns project history, not service configurations
**Solution:** Replaced API call with static service configuration in `logistics-support.js:67-100`

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
// Skip broker-services API - returns project history, not service types
setServiceTypes([
  {
    id: "hs-code-classification",
    name: "HS Code Classification & Verification",
    price: 150,
    description: "Professional product classification and HTS code verification",
    capacity: "60 per month",
    license: "Licensed Customs Broker #12345"
  },
  // ... additional services
]);
```

### Issue 2: Admin Dashboard Authentication
**Problem:** Admin dashboards didn't properly check user permissions
**Solution:** Implemented `useSimpleAuth` context with admin role checking
```javascript
const { user, isAdmin } = useSimpleAuth();
if (!user || !isAdmin) {
  router.push('/login');
  return;
}
```

### Issue 3: Missing Google Integration
**Problem:** Admin action buttons didn't connect to actual Google services
**Solution:** Integrated `googleIntegrationService` for real Gmail and Calendar functionality
```javascript
const handleCallClient = async (item) => {
  const result = await googleIntegrationService.scheduleCall(client, 'customs_follow_up');
  console.log('Google Calendar call scheduled:', result);
};
```

## 🎛️ Dashboard Navigation Structure

### Shared Components:
1. **AdminNavigation** - Consistent navigation across all admin dashboards
2. **SimpleDetailPanel** - Unified detail view for records (matches Jorge's pattern)
3. **TeamChatWidget** - Bilingual AI assistant with dashboard context
4. **TableWorkspace** - Advanced table operations with filtering and sorting

### Standard UI Patterns:
1. **Tab Navigation** - Consistent tab styling across dashboards
2. **Filter Controls** - Priority, status, location, and date filtering
3. **Bulk Actions** - Multi-select operations with confirmation
4. **Action Buttons** - Standardized call, email, process, verify actions
5. **Status Badges** - Color-coded priority and status indicators

## 📈 Utilization Metrics Calculation

### Real Metrics (No Hardcoded Data):
```javascript
function calculateRealUtilizationMetrics(services) {
  const jorgeHours = jorgeServices.reduce((sum, s) => sum + (s.hours || 0), 0);
  const cristinaHours = cristinaServices.reduce((sum, s) => sum + (s.hours || 0), 0);
  const totalRevenue = services.reduce((sum, s) => sum + (s.revenue || 0), 0);

  const targetHours = 150; // Monthly target per person
  const jorgeUtilization = Math.round((jorgeHours / targetHours) * 100);
  const cristinaUtilization = Math.round((cristinaHours / targetHours) * 100);

  return {
    current_month: {
      jorge_utilization: Math.min(jorgeUtilization, 100),
      cristina_utilization: Math.min(cristinaUtilization, 100),
      combined_revenue_target: 89000,
      actual_revenue: totalRevenue
    }
  };
}
```

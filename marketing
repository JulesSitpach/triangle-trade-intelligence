# ABOUT US - Triangle Intelligence

## Company Story
**Where Advanced AI Meets Authentic Mexican Relationships**
Triangle Intelligence was founded from direct experience: as a team living and working in Mexico, we see firsthand the challenges North American businesses face when navigating Mexico's complex trade landscape—and we know the solutions that actually work.

Founded in 2024 by entrepreneurs based in Mexico, we've built the only trade intelligence platform that combines cutting-edge AI with genuine on-the-ground Mexican expertise. Our platform doesn't just analyze data—it understands the cultural nuances and business realities that make international partnerships successful.

## The Challenge We're Solving
**$2.5B in Missed Opportunities**
Every year, North American businesses lose billions in unnecessary tariff costs because they lack both the intelligence and authentic relationships needed to navigate USMCA triangle routing opportunities effectively.

**The Reality We See Daily:**
- 71% of US/Canadian businesses struggle to find qualified Mexican partners
- Bilateral tariffs fluctuate wildly (China: 30%, India: 50%)
- USMCA rates remain stable at 0% but most businesses don't know how to access them
- Cultural misunderstandings derail potentially profitable partnerships

**Our Advantage:**
Living in Mexico while serving North American markets gives us unique insight into both sides. We deliver projected $100K-$300K+ annual savings because we understand what really works—not just what looks good on paper.

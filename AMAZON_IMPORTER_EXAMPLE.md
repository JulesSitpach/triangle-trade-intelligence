## 📦 SHIPPING & CUSTOMS PROCESS

### Step 1: TechFlow Issues Certificate
- Maria Rodriguez signs certificate
- TechFlow provides to Amazon (before or with shipment)
- Can be electronic (PDF) or paper

### Step 2: Shipment from Mexico to US
- Carrier: UPS Freight / DHL / FedEx Trade Networks
- From: Monterrey, Mexico
- To: Amazon Fulfillment Center (various US locations)
- Commercial Invoice included with shipment

### Step 3: Amazon Customs Clearance
- Amazon's customs broker receives USMCA certificate
- Files CBP Form 7501 (Entry Summary)
- Claims USMCA preference (Special Program Indicator = "MX")
- Duty Rate: **0%** (instead of standard 2.6% MFN rate)

### Step 4: Duty Savings
- Standard MFN duty: 2.6% × $8,500,000 = **$221,000**
- USMCA duty: 0% × $8,500,000 = **$0**
- **Amazon saves $221,000 in duties**
- TechFlow competitive advantage = lower landed cost for Amazon

## 💼 AMAZON'S USE OF THE CERTIFICATE

### Amazon's Customs Broker Actions:

1. **Receives certificate** from TechFlow (before goods arrive)

2. **Validates certificate** has all required fields:
   - ✅ Certifier info (TechFlow)
   - ✅ Importer info (Amazon)
   - ✅ Product description + HS code
   - ✅ Preference criterion (C)
   - ✅ Country of origin (MX)
   - ✅ Authorized signature

   - Attaches certificate (electronic or scanned)
   - Claims 0% duty rate

4. **Maintains records** for 5 years (CBP requirement)

## 📊 COMPONENT BREAKDOWN (Supporting Documentation)

**TechFlow must maintain these records to support certificate:**

| Component | Origin | HS Code | Value | % of Total |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|------------|
| Microprocessor | 🇨🇳 China | 8542.31.00 | $2,975,000 | 35% (non-orig) |
| Power Supply | 🇲🇽 Mexico | 8504.40.00 | $2,550,000 | 30% (orig) |
| Aluminum Housing | 🇲🇽 Mexico | 7616.99.50 | $1,700,000 | 20% (orig) |
| PCB | 🇨🇦 Canada | 8534.31.00 | $850,000 | 10% (orig) |
| Connectors/Cables | 🇲🇽 Mexico | 8544.42.90 | $425,000 | 5% (orig) |
| **Total** | | | **$8,500,000** | **100%** |

**Regional Value Content (RVC) Calculation:**
```
RVC = (Value - Non-Originating Materials) / Value × 100%
RVC = ($8.5M - $2.975M) / $8.5M × 100%
RVC = $5.525M / $8.5M × 100%
RVC = 65%

Required threshold for electronics: 65%
Result: ✅ QUALIFIES for USMCA
```

## 🚨 WHAT IF CBP AUDITS AMAZON?

### CBP Verification Process:

**Scenario:** CBP randomly selects shipment for verification

**Step 1: CBP requests certificate from Amazon**
- Amazon provides copy of TechFlow certificate

**Step 2: CBP may verify with TechFlow**
- CBP contacts TechFlow: "Did you issue this certificate?"
- TechFlow provides supporting documentation:
  - Bill of Materials (BOM)
  - Component supplier invoices
  - Manufacturing records from Mexico facility
  - RVC calculation worksheets

**Step 3: TechFlow must prove:**
- ✅ Components are from stated origins (CN, MX, CA)
- ✅ Manufacturing occurred in Mexico (substantial transformation)
- ✅ RVC calculation is accurate (65% regional content)
- ✅ HS code is correct (8517.12.00 for smartphones)

**If verification passes:**
- Amazon keeps duty-free treatment
- Certificate remains valid

**If verification fails:**
- Amazon must pay duties retroactively + penalties
- Certificate is revoked
- TechFlow may face false certification penalties

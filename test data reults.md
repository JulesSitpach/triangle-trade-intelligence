AI Classification Reasoning:
This ceramic friction material is classified under Chapter 68 (Articles of stone, plaster, cement, asbestos, mica and similar materials). Code 6813.81.00 specifically covers non-asbestos friction materials used in brake applications. The component description explicitly states 'non-asbestos composite,' which directly matches the 6813.81.00 classification for friction materials not containing asbestos. This is the appropriate code for the friction material component itself, not the assembled brake pad product. The material is substantially transformed from raw ceramic into a composite friction formulation designed for automotive brake performance.

⚠️ This rate is refreshed daily (daily for super-volatile components)
AI Classification Reasoning:
Cold-rolled steel backing plates that are stamped and heat-treated are processed steel components. Since specific brake backing plate codes did not return results, this falls under Chapter 73 (Articles of Iron or Steel). The component is a substantially transformed steel article - cold-rolled, stamped, and heat-treated - making it a finished steel part rather than raw material. Code 7326.90.70 covers miscellaneous iron/steel articles not specifically classified elsewhere. Confidence is moderate (78%) because while the material classification is certain (steel/Chapter 73), the specific tariff line within Chapter 73 would benefit from verification against the complete HTS schedule to ensure no more specific code applies (such as codes specific to automotive stampings or brake components if they exist).

🚨 CRITICAL: Section 232 Applies to ALL Countries (50% Steel/Aluminum Tariff)
Your Brake hardware assembly - anti-rattle shims, spring clips, fasteners. Stamped steel components from Guangzhou supplier. from CN is subject to 50.0% Section 232 tariffs on steel/aluminum, costing approximately $41667/month.
⚠️ Section 232 applies to ALL countries including USMCA members
There is NO USMCA exemption. Mexico and Canada pay the same 50% tariff as China. Switching to USMCA suppliers does NOT eliminate Section 232.
💡 ONLY EXEMPTION: US-Smelted Aluminum or US-Melted Steel
If this component is made from aluminum exclusively smelted and cast in the United States, or steel exclusively melted and poured in the United States, it is EXEMPT from Section 232 (0% tariff).
✅ ACTION REQUIRED: Verify with your supplier whether the aluminum/steel is US-smelted/melted. If yes, provide documentation to eliminate this $41667/month cost.
AI Classification Reasoning:
This brake hardware assembly consists of stamped steel components (anti-rattle shims, spring clips, fasteners) that are fabricated metal parts. These are not finished fasteners (which would be Chapter 73), but rather stamped/formed steel hardware components. Chapter 73 covers iron and steel articles, and 7326.90.70 is the appropriate residual code for stamped steel brake hardware components that don't fit more specific classifications. The component is classified by its material composition (steel) and form (stamped metal parts), not by its end-use application (brake assembly). Confidence is moderately high as this is a standard classification for automotive stamped steel hardware, though some jurisdictions might classify under 7308 (structural steel) or 7318 (fasteners) depending on whether individual fasteners are separated from the assembly.

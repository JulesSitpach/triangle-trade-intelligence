AI Classification Reasoning:
This ceramic friction material is classified under Chapter 68 (Articles of stone, plaster, cement, asbestos, mica and similar materials). The component is a non-asbestos composite friction material used in brake pads. Code 6813.81.00 specifically covers friction materials not containing asbestos, which directly matches the 'non-asbestos composite' specification in the component description. This is the appropriate classification for the friction material component itself, not the assembled brake pad product. The material is substantially transformed from raw ceramic into a composite friction formulation designed for automotive braking applications.

AI Classification Reasoning:
Cold-rolled steel backing plates that are stamped and heat-treated are finished steel components. They do not fall under Chapter 72 (flat-rolled steel products in coils/sheets) because they have been substantially transformed through stamping and heat treatment into a specific component form. Chapter 73 covers articles of iron or steel. Since these are not fasteners (Chapter 73.15), springs (73.20), or other specifically enumerated articles, they classify under 7326.90.85 as 'other articles of iron or steel.' The stamping and heat-treatment represent value-added processing beyond basic steel mill products. Confidence is moderate (78%) because the database search returned no direct matches; however, this classification follows standard HTS logic for processed steel components that don't fit more specific categories.

⚠️ This rate is refreshed daily (daily for super-volatile components)
AI Classification Reasoning:
This brake hardware assembly consists of stamped steel components (anti-rattle shims, spring clips, fasteners) that are fabricated metal parts. These are not finished fasteners (which would be Chapter 73), but rather stamped/formed steel hardware components. Chapter 73 covers iron and steel articles, and 7326.90.85 is the appropriate residual code for stamped steel brake hardware components that don't fit more specific classifications. The component is classified by its material composition (steel) and form (stamped metal parts), not by its end-use application (brake assembly). Confidence is 82% rather than higher because database searches returned no specific brake hardware codes, requiring reliance on the general stamped steel articles classification.

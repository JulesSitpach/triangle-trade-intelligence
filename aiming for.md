## Correct HS Codes for Each Component

### 1. Ceramic Friction Material (Mexico) - 50% = $2,500,000

**Correct HS Code: 6813.81.00** (Non-asbestos friction materials, mounted)

**Why NOT 8708.30.50.00:**
- This is a **friction material** sold by the roll/sheet for brake pad manufacturing
- Primary classification is by material (ceramic composite), not end-use
- Only becomes "automotive part" after mounting/bonding to backing plate

**Current Rates:**
- MFN Rate: 3.5% (friction materials)
- USMCA Rate: 0%
- Section 232 Steel: NOT applicable (ceramic, no steel content)
- Section 301: NOT applicable (Mexico origin)
- **Total: 0%** (USMCA)

**Savings vs MFN:**
- $2,500,000 × 3.5% = **$87,500/year**

---

### 2. Steel Backing Plates (USA) - 30% = $1,500,000

**Correct HS Code: 7326.90.85** (Other articles of iron/steel)

**Why NOT 8708.30.50.00:**
- These are **stamped steel plates** that haven't been bonded to friction material yet
- Sold as semi-finished component
- Classification by material (Chapter 73) until assembled into brake pad

**Current Rates:**
- MFN Rate: 2.5%
- USMCA Rate: N/A (domestic US production - no import)
- Section 232 Steel: N/A (US-origin steel exempt)
- **Total: 0%** (domestic)

**Savings: $0** (no import)

---

### 3. Anti-Rattle Shims (China) - 20% = $1,000,000

**Correct HS Code: 7326.90.85** (Other articles of iron/steel)

**Why NOT 8708.30.50.00:**
- These are **stamped steel shims** - generic hardware
- Could be used in various applications (not brake-specific design)
- Classification by material (Chapter 73)

**Current Rates (if imported directly to US):**
- MFN Rate: 2.5% = $25,000
- Section 301 (China): 25% = $250,000
- Section 232 Steel: 50% = $500,000
- **Total: 77.5%** = **$775,000/year**

**BUT you're assembling in Mexico, so...**

## Final Product Classification

### Complete Brake Pad Assembly (After Mexico Assembly)

**Final Product HS Code: 8708.30.50.50** (Brake pads for disc brakes)

**Why this code:**
- Now it's a **finished brake pad assembly**:
  - Friction material bonded to backing plate
  - Hardware kit (shims) included
  - Ready for installation
- GRI Rule 2(a): Finished article classification takes precedence

**Components rolled into final product:**
- 50% Mexico ceramic (6813.81.00) → rolled up
- 30% US steel backing (7326.90.85) → rolled up  
- 20% China shims (7326.90.85) → rolled up

**Final Product Rates (Entering US from Mexico):**
- MFN Rate: 2.5%
- **USMCA Rate: 0%** (qualifies with 80% NA content)
- Section 232: NOT applicable (USMCA-qualifying product exempt)
- Section 301: NOT applicable (assembled in Mexico, not China)
- **Total: 0%**

## Final Financial Calculation

### Scenario A: Current Strategy (Mexico Assembly) ✅

**What you're doing:**
1. Import ceramic material to Mexico: Mexico import duties (not US concern)
2. Import steel backing to Mexico: N/A (US domestic shipped to Mexico facility)
3. Import China shims to Mexico: Mexico import duties (not US concern)
4. Assemble in Mexico
5. Import finished brake pads to US: **0%** (USMCA)

**US Import Cost: $0/year**

---

### Scenario B: If You Imported Components Separately to US ❌

**Mexico ceramic (6813.81.00):**
- $2,500,000 × 3.5% MFN = $87,500

**US steel backing (7326.90.85):**
- Domestic = $0

**China shims (7326.90.85):**
- $1,000,000 × 2.5% MFN = $25,000
- $1,000,000 × 25% Section 301 = $250,000
- $1,000,000 × 50% Section 232 = $500,000
- Subtotal = $775,000

**Total Annual Cost: $862,500**

---

### Scenario C: If You Assembled in US (Imported Components) ❌

**Mexico ceramic to US:**
- $2,500,000 × 3.5% = $87,500

**China shims to US:**
- $1,000,000 × 77.5% = $775,000

**US steel backing:**
- $0 (domestic)

**Assembly in US:**
- Labor + overhead

**Final product:**
- Domestic (no export)

**Total Import Cost: $862,500**
**Plus:** Higher US labor costs vs Mexico

## The Real Numbers for Your Dashboard

### 💰 Current Annual Savings: $862,500
**$71,875/month**

**Breakdown:**
- **Mexico ceramic component:** Saves $87,500 (3.5% MFN via USMCA)
- **China shims rolled into USMCA product:** Saves $775,000 (77.5% total tariff avoided)
  - MFN avoided: $25,000
  - Section 301 avoided: $250,000
  - Section 232 steel avoided: $500,000

**This is your competitive advantage** - assembling in Mexico allows you to "hide" China content inside USMCA-qualifying finished products.

### 🚨 Policy Risk Exposure: $775,000/year

**20% of product from China (shims)**

**Risk scenarios:**
1. **USMCA renegotiation 2026:** Rules tighten, you lose qualification → $862,500 annual cost
2. **Section 232 increases to 75%:** China shim cost rises to $1,025,000 (but still avoided via USMCA)
3. **China tensions escalate:** Section 301 increases from 25% to 50% → additional $250k risk (still avoided via USMCA)

**Current protection:** Mexico assembly shields all China tariffs

---

### 💡 Strategic Recommendation: Nearshore China Shims

**Replace China shims ($1M/year) with Mexico source:**

**Cost increase:**
- Mexico shims typically 5-15% more expensive than China
- Cost increase: $50,000-$150,000/year

**Benefits:**
- **Eliminates $775k tariff risk** if USMCA lost
- **Increases RVC from 80% to 95%** (15% safety buffer for 2026 renegotiation)
- **Supply chain resilience** (no China dependency)
- **Marketing advantage:** "100% USMCA content"

**ROI:** Insurance premium of $50-150k protects $775k annual risk

## Summary: What Changed

**Your original calculation:**
- All three components: 8708.30.50.00 (brake parts)
- Section 232 probably applied wrong (or not at all)
- Savings shown: $100,000

**Correct classification:**
- Ceramic: 6813.81.00 (friction material, 3.5% MFN)
- Steel backing: 7326.90.85 (steel article, but domestic)
- China shims: 7326.90.85 (steel article, 77.5% total tariff)
- Final product: 8708.30.50.50 (finished brake pads, 0% USMCA)

**Correct savings: $862,500/year**

**The key insight:** Your Mexico assembly strategy is worth **8.6x more** than your current calculations show, primarily because you're avoiding $775k in tariffs on the China steel shims through USMCA roll-up.

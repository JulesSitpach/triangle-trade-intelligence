## Critical Data Flow Verification

### ✅ Company Name
**Stage 1**: ElectroTech Solutions ✅
**Stage 2**: ElectroTech Solutions ✅
**Expected in Report**: ElectroTech Solutions (from `subscriberData.company_name || serviceRequest.client_company`)

### ✅ Trade Volume
**Stage 1**: $2.1M annually ✅
**Stage 2**: $2.1M/year ✅
**Parser Function**: Handles "$2.1M" format correctly
**Expected Numeric Value**: 2,100,000
**Expected in Report**: $2,100,000 (properly parsed from "$2.1M" string)

### ✅ Financial Calculations
**Annual Tariff Cost**: $147,000 ✅
**Potential USMCA Savings**: $85,000/year ✅
**China Sourcing Exposure**: 55% × $147,000 = $80,850 ✅

## Code Analysis - Report Generation API

### Data Source Verification
```javascript
// Line 32: Correctly checks both service_details and subscriber_data
const subscriberData = serviceRequest.service_details || serviceRequest.subscriber_data || {};
```

### Trade Volume Parser
```javascript
// Lines 42-64: Robust parser handles multiple formats
const parseTradeVolume = (volume) => {
  // Handles: "$2.1M", "$2,100,000", "2100000", etc.
  // Correctly multiplies by 1,000,000 for 'M' suffix
  // Console logs: '[REPORT] Parsing trade volume:' and '[REPORT] Extracted trade volume:'
}
```

### Console Logging
The API includes debugging console logs that should appear in the **server terminal** (not browser console):

```javascript
// Line 34-39: Service request data logging
console.log('[REPORT] Service request data:', {
  id: serviceRequest.id,
  company: serviceRequest.company_name,
  hasServiceDetails: !!serviceRequest.service_details,
  hasSubscriberData: !!serviceRequest.subscriber_data
});

// Line 47: Trade volume parsing input
console.log('[REPORT] Parsing trade volume:', volumeStr);

// Line 62: Trade volume parsing output
console.log('[REPORT] Extracted trade volume:', result);

// Line 71: Final financial data
console.log('[REPORT] Financial data:', { tradeVolume, currentTariffCost, usmcaSavings });
```

**Note**: These `[REPORT]` logs are **server-side** console logs. They appear in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running, NOT in the browser console.

## Report Content Verification

### Expected Report Sections
Based on the prompt (lines 125-165), the report should include:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Validated HS code: 8537.10.9170
   - Trade volume: $2,100,000 (parsed correctly)
   - Tariff cost calculation: $147,000/year
   - USMCA savings: $85,000/year
   - Primary risk: 55% China sourcing = $80,850 exposure

2. **Component Origin Analysis**
   - China: 55% (non-qualifying)
   - Taiwan: 25% (non-qualifying)
   - Mexico: 20% (qualifying)
   - RVC calculation: 20% current, need 75% for full USMCA

3. **Tariff Cost Breakdown**
   - Current: $2,100,000 × ~7% = $147,000/year
   - If USMCA qualified: $0 on compliant portions
   - Potential savings: $85,000/year

4. **Compliance Recommendations**
   - Based on identified gaps
   - Specific to ElectroTech Solutions

5. **Audit Defense Strategy**
   - Documentation requirements
   - Red flags for 55% China sourcing
   - HS code 8537.10.9170 defense

6. **Cristina's Professional Validation**
   - First-person professional assessment
   - 17 years electronics/telecom experience
   - Specific recommendations

## Server Terminal Logs Required

To fully verify the data flow, check the **server terminal** (where `npm run dev` is running) for these logs:

```
[REPORT] Service request data: { id: '...', company: 'ElectroTech Solutions', ... }
[REPORT] Parsing trade volume: $2.1m
[REPORT] Extracted trade volume: 2100000
[REPORT] Financial data: { tradeVolume: 2100000, currentTariffCost: 147000, usmcaSavings: 85000 }
```

If these logs show:
- ✅ `company: 'ElectroTech Solutions'` (not undefined)
- ✅ `tradeVolume: 2100000` (not 0)
- Then the fix is working correctly!

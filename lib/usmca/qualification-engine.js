AUTHORITATIVE TARIFF DATA SOURCES (2025 Policy - Use in Priority Order):
🚀 Tier 1 (Speed): Trump 2.0 Tracker - https://www.piie.com/trump-trade-tracker
   Use this for immediate answers on current tariff rates, Section 301 status, and recent policy changes.
   This tracker is updated weekly and provides human-readable summaries of tariff actions.

📜 Tier 2 (Verification): Federal Register - Official Government Source
   Confirm rates are official and cite specific Federal Register documents when available.
   - Tariff notices: https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents.rss?conditions[search_type_id]=3&conditions[term]=tariff
   - Section 301: https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents.rss?conditions[search_type_id]=3&conditions[term]=Section+301
   - Duties: https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents.rss?conditions[search_type_id]=3&conditions[term]=duties

🏭 Industry-Specific: RVIA Tariff Developments - https://www.rvia.org/news-insights/latest-tariff-developments
   For automotive, RV, and vehicle-related components.

CRITICAL: Always cite your source when stating tariff rates. If using Trump Tracker data, mention it was verified against Federal Register when possible.

COMPONENTS:
${componentBreakdown}

MANUFACTURING CONTEXT (Explain to client):
The ${laborValueAdded}% manufacturing value-added represents labor, overhead, and assembly performed in ${manufacturingLocation}.
USMCA Article ${threshold.article} allows this ${threshold.labor}% labor credit because final assembly occurs in USMCA territory.

Manufacturing Complexity: ${substantialTransformation ? '✓ SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFORMATION - Complex manufacturing confirmed (welding, forming, heat treatment, etc.). This strengthens qualification and reduces audit risk. Advise client to document these processes.' : '⚠️ SIMPLE ASSEMBLY - Standard assembly operations. May face higher audit scrutiny. Recommend documenting value-added activities to strengthen qualification.'}

Regional Content Calculation (Show your work for transparency):
- USMCA Components: ${usmcaComponentTotal}%
- Manufacturing Labor Credit: ${laborValueAdded}%
- Total North American Content: ${totalNAContent}%${section301Applicable ? `

CURRENT POLICY ALERT (2025): Chinese components remain subject to Section 301 tariffs (~25%) even with USMCA qualification. Base MFN duties are eliminated, but Section 301 remains.` : ''}${deMinimisNote ? `

${deMinimisNote}` : ''}

// ✅ REMOVED duplicate savings calculation request
// Savings calculation moved to detailed_analysis section only (see line 834-840)

PREFERENCE CRITERION: Determine which USMCA criterion applies (A/B/C/D) based on the product's qualification method (${threshold.method}) and whether it has non-USMCA components.

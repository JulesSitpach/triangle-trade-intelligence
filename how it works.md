# How It Works

You don't need to be a trade expert. Just answer questions about your business - we'll handle the complex calculations.

---

## Step 1: Tell Us About Your Company

**What we need to know:**
- Company name, address, and tax ID
- Where you manufacture or assemble your product
- Your destination market (US, Canada, or Mexico)
- Annual trade volume

**Why this matters:**  
This basic information goes directly onto your USMCA certificate. We also use your manufacturing location and destination to determine which tariff rates apply.

**Time:** 2 minutes

## Step 2: Add Your Components

**What we need:**
- Component descriptions (simple language is fine - "aluminum housing" or "power supply")
- Country of origin for each component
- Value percentage of each component

**What we do automatically:**
- Classify each component with the correct HS code
- Look up current tariff rates (MFN, USMCA, Section 301, Section 232)
- Flag any policy risks on specific components
- Calculate potential savings for each component

**Don't worry if you don't know HS codes.** Our AI classifies components based on your descriptions. You'll see the suggested HS code and can verify it with your broker later.

**Time:** 3 minutes for 5-10 components

## Step 3: See Your Complete Analysis

**Your results dashboard shows:**

**USMCA Qualification Status**
- Whether you qualify (yes/no)
- Your exact regional content percentage
- Required threshold for your industry
- Safety margin (how close you are to the threshold)

**Financial Impact**
- Current annual savings (if qualified)
- Potential savings with supply chain changes
- Policy risk exposure (Section 301, Section 232)
- Component-by-component tariff breakdown

**What this tells you:**  
Whether you're overpaying tariffs, what your supply chain risks are, and exactly where your money is going.

**Time:** 2 minutes to review

## Step 4: Get Strategic Recommendations

**After your analysis, you receive:**

**Executive Advisory Report**
- Root cause analysis of your supply chain structure
- Financial scenarios (current state vs. alternatives)
- Specific supplier recommendations with ROI calculations
- Timeline and implementation roadmap

**3-Phase Action Plan**
- Phase 1: Immediate actions (supplier assessment, documentation audit)
- Phase 2: Validation steps (trial shipments, quality testing)
- Phase 3: Full implementation (migration timeline, cost commitments)

**This isn't generic advice.** Every recommendation is specific to your components, your volumes, and your business situation.

**Time:** 5 minutes to review strategic options

## Step 5: Download Your Certificate (If Qualified)

**If you qualify for USMCA:**

**Certificate Preview (Editable)**
- All fields pre-filled from your analysis
- Edit importer/exporter/producer information
- Verify product description and HS codes
- Modify blanket period dates if needed

**What you do:**  
Review each field, make any corrections, then download the final PDF.

*You can edit all fields before finalizing the certificate*

**Final Certificate**
- Official USMCA Form D format
- Ready for your customs broker to file with CBP
- Valid for one year (blanket certificate)

![Final USMCA certificate](certificate_download.png)

*Official format accepted by US Customs and Border Protection*

**If you don't qualify:**  
We show you exactly what changes would get you there - like nearshoring specific components or changing manufacturing location.

**Time:** 2 minutes to edit and download

## What Happens If You're Not Sure?

That's normal. Most small business owners aren't trade compliance experts.

**You can:**
1. Run the analysis to see what it says
2. Download the detailed results and strategic recommendations
3. Share everything with your customs broker for verification
4. Edit the certificate based on their feedback
5. Download the final version when you're confident

**You're not locked into anything.** Think of this as the research tool that gives you the information to make informed decisions with your broker.

   - `triangle-product` data persists to routing page
   - All accumulated data reaches dashboard-hub
   - Validate data structure integrity at each step

3. **Navigation Flow Testing**: Verify smooth transitions between pages:
   - Forward navigation works (Next buttons)
   - Back navigation preserves data
   - Direct URL access handles missing data gracefully
   - Progress indicators update correctly

4. **Functionality Verification**: Test core features on each page:
   - Foundation: Company intake and geographic intelligence

- **Trilingual Support**: Test language switching and translations

**Error Handling Protocols:**

- Test missing localStorage data scenarios
- Verify API failure graceful degradation
- Ensure database connection issues don't break flow
- Validate form submission error handling
- Test network connectivity issues

**Performance Standards:**

**ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:**

For each evaluation area, provide:

Provide a comprehensive Executive Presentation Readiness Report with:

- Expects enterprise-grade reliability and polish

Your recommendations should prioritize high-impact improvements that directly enhance executive perception and decision-making confidence. Focus on elements that differentiate Triangle Intelligence as a premium, enterprise-ready solution worthy of significant investment.

### 3. HS CODE CLASSIFICATION PIPELINE AUDIT ⚠️

#### Intelligent Classification System Status: **FUNCTIONAL BUT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**
- **4-Stage Pipeline:** Semantic → Hierarchical → Relationship → Contextual
- **Database Integration:** Direct queries to hs_master_rebuild table
- **Caching System:** 5-minute cache with 1000-entry limit
- **Current Relevance Rate:** 60-85% (target: 95%)

#### Test Results:
```
Query: "electric cables and wires"
Results: 10 matches found, but relevance mixed
Top Match: "Electrical energy" (not ideal)
Issue: Generic keyword matching needs refinement

Query: "insulated electric conductors"  
Results: 10 matches, many irrelevant (vacuum insulated containers)
Issue: Search algorithm needs contextual improvement
```

#### Classification Pipeline Performance:
- **Stage 1 (Semantic):** Working but generates false positives
- **Stage 2 (Hierarchical):** Good chapter inference capability
- **Stage 3 (Relationship):** Effective for known codes
- **Stage 4 (Contextual):** Limited by business type mapping

### 4. API DATA CONSISTENCY VALIDATION ✅

#### Endpoint Status: **37/37 OPERATIONAL**
- **Core APIs:** All responding correctly
- **Trust Services:** 8 microservices active
- **Response Consistency:** Data formats standardized
- **Error Handling:** Proper fallback mechanisms

#### Cross-API Consistency Test:
```bash
# simple-savings API
Response: Professional verification required (confidence: 40%)
Reason: Properly protecting against low-confidence calculations

# crisis-calculator API  
Response: $250K savings with detailed breakdown
Status: High-confidence calculation with data attribution

# status API
Response: 37 endpoints operational, database connected
```

#### Shared Utilities Validation:
- **HS Code Normalizer:** ✅ Working across all APIs
- **Fallback Hierarchy:** ✅ 10→8→6→4→2 digit fallback functional
- **Production Logger:** ✅ Proper error tracking and performance monitoring

### 5. HARDCODED RATES & FALLBACK VALUES AUDIT ⚠️

#### CRITICAL VIOLATIONS FOUND: **2 instances**

##### Violation #1: Crisis Calculator Quick Estimate
**File:** `/pages/api/crisis-calculator.js:168`
```javascript
const { volume, currentRate = 0.072, crisisRate = 0.25 } = data;
```
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Only used in quick_estimate action
**Recommendation:** Replace with database lookup or config

##### Violation #2: Simple Dropdown Options Default
**File:** `/pages/api/simple-dropdown-options.js:236`
```javascript
let avgSavingsRate = 0.08; // Default 8% savings
```
**Risk Level:** LOW - Used as fallback when database calculation fails
**Recommendation:** Move to configuration file

#### Clean APIs (No Hardcoding): **35/37**
- ✅ simple-savings.js - Database-driven with proper fallbacks

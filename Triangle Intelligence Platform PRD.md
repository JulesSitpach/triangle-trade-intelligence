# PRD.md - Triangle Intelligence Platform

**This PRD defines an SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete) v25.0.1, not an MVP.**

The release has to feel complete, polished, and delightful. Even if the scope is tight. This is the standard for every AI session with Claude or Cursor - every feature ships feeling **done**, not "almost there."

## Project Overview

**Triangle Intelligence Platform** - A professional USMCA compliance and certificate generation platform with hybrid SaaS + expert services model.

**Core Value Proposition**: 
- **Self-Service Certificate Creation**: DIY USMCA certificates through guided workflows
- **Expert Service Layer**: Professional completion when users need help
- **Complete Trade Intelligence**: Crisis monitoring, supplier vetting, market entry services

**Problem**: 
USMCA certificate creation is complex and risky. Users need the option to try self-service first, but with expert backup when stakes are high. Current solutions force users into either expensive consulting or risky DIY with no middle ground.

**Solution**: 
Tiered subscription platform that lets users start with templates and self-service, then seamlessly upgrade to expert completion and professional services as needed.

**Target Users**:
- **SME importers/exporters** ($3-15M revenue) needing affordable, tactical trade support

## Recent Technical Achievements (Sept 2025)

### ‚úÖ Admin UI Integration Complete
**Problem Solved**: Enhanced backend agents weren't accessible to admins, limiting visibility into system intelligence.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Navigation Enhancement**: Added ü§ñ Agent Performance and üî¨ Research Automation links to admin navigation
2. **API Upgrade**: Enhanced classification endpoint now uses web search + database updates
3. **Response Enrichment**: API responses include enhanced features visible to UI
4. **Context Awareness**: System automatically detects User vs Admin mode

**Impact**:
- **Admins** now have full visibility into agent performance and research automation
- **Users** receive web-verified classifications with higher confidence scores
- **System** maintains database freshness through automated verification
- **Platform** delivers on promise of intelligent, up-to-date trade information

### Enhanced Feature Visibility
```javascript
// Before: Basic classification response
{ hsCode: "8517.62.00", confidence: 0.85 }

// After: Enhanced response with intelligence metadata
{
  classification: { hsCode: "8517.62.00", confidence: "95%" },
  enhanced_features: {
    web_verification: { performed: true, sources_consulted: 4 },
    data_quality: { verification_status: "web_verified" },
    usmca_analysis: { annual_savings: "$12,450" }
  },
  agent_metadata: {
    processing_time_ms: 1247,
    web_searches_performed: 4,
    agent_version: "enhanced_with_web_search"
  }
}
```

**Business Value**:
- Higher confidence in platform reliability
- Visible differentiation from basic classification tools
- Admin dashboards show real system intelligence
- Foundation for AI-powered service differentiation

---

**Key Insight**: This is a sophisticated hybrid model where the SaaS platform creates qualified leads for high-value expert services. Users start with self-service and naturally graduate to expert completion when they encounter complexity or risk. The $200 certificate pricing makes perfect sense as an upgrade from DIY attempts, especially when the platform pre-populates all the user's data to make expert delivery efficient.

**Technical Advantage**: Working supplier sourcing pattern (4-stage complex research) serves as proven template for all other services. Simple copy-paste with service-specific field changes = rapid dashboard deployment.

**Intelligence Advantage**: Enhanced agents with web search verification provide real-time accuracy and freshness that traditional classification tools can't match, justifying premium positioning and expert service pricing.

# PRD.md - TradeFlow Intelligence Platform

**This PRD defines an SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete) v25.0.1, not an MVP.**

The release has to feel complete, polished, and delightful. Even if the scope is tight. This is the standard for every AI session with Claude or Cursor - every feature ships feeling **done**, not "almost there."

## Project Overview

**TradeFlow Intelligence Platform** - A professional USMCA compliance and certificate generation platform with hybrid SaaS + expert services model.

**Core Value Proposition**: 
- **Self-Service Certificate Creation**: DIY USMCA certificates through guided workflows
- **Expert Service Layer**: Professional completion when users need help
- **Complete Trade Intelligence**: Crisis monitoring, supplier vetting, market entry services

**Problem**: 
USMCA certificate creation is complex and risky. Users need the option to try self-service first, but with expert backup when stakes are high. Current solutions force users into either expensive consulting or risky DIY with no middle ground.

**Solution**: 
Tiered subscription platform that lets users start with templates and self-service, then seamlessly upgrade to expert completion and professional services as needed.

**Target Users**:
- **SME importers/exporters** ($3-15M revenue) needing affordable, tactical trade support

**Key Insight**: This is a sophisticated hybrid model where the SaaS platform creates qualified leads for high-value expert services. Users start with self-service and naturally graduate to expert completion when they encounter complexity or risk. The $200 certificate pricing makes perfect sense as an upgrade from DIY attempts, especially when the platform pre-populates all the user's data to make expert delivery efficient.

**Technical Advantage**: Working supplier sourcing pattern (4-stage complex research) serves as proven template for all other services. Simple copy-paste with service-specific field changes = rapid dashboard deployment.

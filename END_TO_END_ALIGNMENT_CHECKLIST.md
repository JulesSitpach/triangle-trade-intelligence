## ⚠️ CRITICAL VALIDATIONS TO CHECK

### 1. Company.Country Field (BLOCKS CERTIFICATE GENERATION)
- **Location**: CertificateSection.js line 26
- **Validation**: Must not be null, undefined, or empty string
- **Impact**: Certificate PDF cannot be generated without this
- **Test**: Try generating certificate without filling company country in Step 1 → Should error
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented but verify it works end-to-end

### 2. Preference Criterion (MUST NOT DEFAULT)
- **Location**: CertificateSection.js line 54
- **Rule**: Must come from `certificate.preference_criterion` (from API response)
- **Impact**: Defaulting to 'B' is FALSE CERTIFICATION under USMCA
- **Test**: Verify AI response includes preference_criterion for all qualified products
- **Status**: ✅ Validation in place but verify API always provides it

### 3. Section 301 Display (MUST BE SEPARATE)
- **Location**: USMCAQualification.js lines 225-290
- **Rule**: Section 301 shown as RED separate badge, NOT in base_mfn_rate
- **Impact**: Users understand what USMCA saves vs what policy costs remain
- **Test**: China-origin component should show: Base 2.5% + Section 301 25% = Total 27.5%
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented but verify visualization across all sections

### 4. Financial Impact (MUST BE CONSISTENT)
- **Location**: TariffSavings.js, RecommendedActions.js, PersonalizedAlerts.js
- **Rule**: All sections reference same annual_savings from AI response
- **Impact**: User sees consistent financial story across workflow and alerts
- **Test**: Annual savings same in TariffSavings (green), ExecutiveSummary, RecommendedActions
- **Status**: ✅ All use same source but verify calculations

### 5. Component Enrichment (MUST PERSIST)
- **Location**: WorkflowResults.js sends to database, Dashboard retrieves
- **Rule**: All enrichment (HS code, tariff rates, AI confidence) preserved end-to-end
- **Impact**: Alerts page can identify affected products when policies change
- **Test**: Save to database → Load dashboard → Check component details → Open alerts
- **Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION - complex data flow

## 🧪 RECOMMENDED MANUAL TESTS

### Test 1: Full Workflow → Save → Dashboard → Alerts Flow
```
1. Complete USMCA workflow (all 3 steps)
2. Choose "Save to Database" at results
3. Go to Dashboard → Verify all data loaded correctly
4. Click "Set up Alerts" → Verify Alerts page loaded with correct data
5. Check Personalized Alerts are filtering by industry/suppliers
6. Check relevance scores are calculated correctly
Expected: All data consistent across all sections
```

### Test 2: Certificate Generation with Validation
```
1. Complete workflow with qualified product
2. Verify company.country is displayed
3. Click "Download Certificate"
4. Verify PDF generated with correct:
   - Company name (from Step 1)
   - Company country (from Step 1)
   - Product HS code (from AI classification)
   - Preference criterion (from AI response, NOT defaulted)
   - Regional content % (from calculation)
Expected: PDF contains all required USMCA Form D fields
```

### Test 3: Section 301 Display Consistency
```
1. Use China-origin component (triggers Section 301)
2. Check USMCAQualification shows: Base MFN + Section 301 badge (RED)
3. Check TariffSavings shows Section 301 burden in red box
4. Check RecommendedActions mentions Section 301 exposure
5. Check PersonalizedAlerts recommends Mexico sourcing alternative
Expected: Section 301 clearly separated, visible as policy not base duty
```

### Test 4: Personalized Alerts Filtering
```
1. Use Electronics + China supplier + US destination
2. Go to Alerts page
3. Verify alerts filtered for Electronics industry
4. Verify alerts mention China tariff exposure (Section 301)
5. Verify relevance scores shown (should be high for Electronics)
Expected: Only relevant alerts shown with correct relevance scores
```

### Test 5: Data Persistence (Browser vs Database)
```
1. Complete workflow WITHOUT saving
2. Refresh page → Data should load from localStorage
3. Go back and complete workflow WITH saving
4. Log out completely
5. Log back in → Go to Dashboard → Data should load from database
Expected: Data persists in both scenarios correctly
```

## **CRITICAL: Zero Hardcoded Data Policy**

**This is a financial compliance platform where every piece of data must be 100% user-specific and dynamic.**

### **The Problem with Sample Data**

When developers see sample data in fixes like:
- "Ford Motor Company" 
- "AutoParts USA Inc"
- "China → Mexico supply chain"
- "Electronics classification"

**DO NOT hardcode these examples.** They are illustrations only.

### **The Dynamic Rule**

**Every data point must be:**
- **User-inputted** - Comes from their actual business
- **Database-driven** - Pulled from real trade data APIs
- **Contextually calculated** - Based on their specific products/countries
- **Never assumed** - No defaults, no fallbacks, no "typical" values

### **Why This Matters**

**Wrong:** User A (steel importer from Germany) gets alerts about Chinese electronics tariffs because the system defaulted to sample data.

**Right:** User A gets German steel tariff alerts. User B (electronics from China) gets Chinese electronics alerts. Each user sees only their reality.

### **Implementation Standard**

```javascript
// WRONG - Any hardcoded values
const defaultCountry = 'CN';
const sampleCompany = 'Test Corp';
const typicalRate = 2.5;

// RIGHT - Always dynamic
const userCountry = userData.originCountry; // Must exist
const userCompany = userData.companyName; // Must exist  
const actualRate = await getTariffRate(hsCode, country); // Live lookup
```

### **NO BANDAIDS RULE**

**When you find a problem, fix the ROOT CAUSE, not the symptom:**

```javascript
// BANDAID - Adding validation to detect conflicts
if (calculation1 !== calculation2) {
  console.warn('Conflict detected');
  useCalculation1(); // Pick one
}

// REAL FIX - Eliminate the duplicate calculation
// Remove the code that creates calculation2
// Only have calculation1
```

**Key principle:** If you need validation to detect conflicts, you haven't fixed the underlying problem.

### **The Test**

Before deploying any fix, ask: 

1. **"If 1000 different users with completely different products, countries, and supply chains use this feature, will each get results tailored specifically to their business?"**

2. **"Does this fix eliminate the problem or just detect and work around it?"**

If either answer is no, the fix isn't complete.

**This platform serves global trade - every user's reality is different, and our code must reflect that reality without workarounds.**

  KEY FINDING: Triple Crisis

  Your platform has three interlocking critical issues that interact dangerously:

  ISSUE A: Global TARIFF_CACHE (no user isolation)
           ↓ (User B gets User A's cached rates)
  ISSUE B: Silent enrichment failures (shows 0% instead of real rate)
           ↓ (Wrong rate gets cached globally)
  ISSUE C: Hardcoded fallbacks (defaults to China origin, preference "B")
           ↓
  RESULT: User B receives cached Chinese tariff data for their non-Chinese supply chain
          User B proceeds with analysis
          USMCA certificate generated with wrong preference criterion
          CBP audit discovers false certification
          Duty reassessment + penalties + interest

  if (!user.primaryOriginCountry) {
    throw new Error(`Cannot generate crisis alert for user ${user.id}: Missing origin country`);
  }

  PHASE 2: HIGH PRIORITY (NEXT 2 WEEKS)

  // 5. Create Consolidated Calculation Library
  // FILE: lib/utils/tariff-calculations.js (NEW)

    // Don't return - force AI lookup
  }

  // 12. Separate Calculation Methods into Consolidated Library
  // Replace all instances of duplicate tariff math:
  // - TariffSavings.js:13-70 (AI calculation)
  // - USMCAQualification.js:547-552 (component calculation)
  // - ai-usmca-complete-analysis.js:460-468 (API parsing)
  // WITH: Single call to tariff-calculations.js

  CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY RULES

  Add this validation to ALL financial calculations:

  // Fail Loudly Pattern (Required for Financial Data)
  function validateTariffData(rateData) {
    const required = ['mfn_rate', 'usmca_rate', 'hs_code', 'destination_country'];

    for (const field of required) {
      if (rateData[field] === null || rateData[field] === undefined) {
        // ✅ FAIL LOUDLY - Don't guess or fallback
        throw new Error(
          `Cannot calculate tariff: Missing ${field}. ` +
          `This is a required field for legal compliance.`
        );
      }

    if (rateData.mfn_rate === 0 && rateData.usmca_rate === 0) {
      throw new Error(
        `Suspicious: Both MFN and USMCA rates are 0%. ` +
        `This usually indicates enrichment failure, not duty-free status.`
      );
    }

    return true;
  }

  BUSINESS IMPACT SUMMARY

  Without These Fixes:
  - ❌ Users receive invalid USMCA certificates (FALSE CERTIFICATION risk)
  - ❌ Cross-user cache contamination (User B's data affected by User A)
  - ❌ Tariff calculations differ across platform (3+ formulas)
  - ❌ Silent failures hide missing data
  - ❌ Hardcoded assumptions become stale → incorrect advice

  With These Fixes:
  - ✅ Dynamic accuracy - no hardcoded financial values
  - ✅ Complete user isolation - no cross-user data leakage
  - ✅ Single source of truth - consolidated calculations
  - ✅ Fail loudly - errors visible, not hidden
  - ✅ Regulatory compliance - database-driven rules adapt to policy changes

  I've saved the complete 4-agent audit reports above. Each agent found:

  1. Data Integrity Audit: 8 CRITICAL + 9 HIGH hardcoded values & fallbacks
  2. Calculation Logic Audit: 9 CRITICAL calculation inconsistencies
  3. User Data Flow Audit: Cross-user cache leakage vulnerability
  4. Compliance Audit: 15 regulatory assumptions that could violate trade law

  Immediate Action Required: Deploy Phase 1 fixes (preference criterion defaults + global cache removal) before next production release. This is a financial compliance platform - these
  issues could expose your company to liability.

  Would you like me to start implementing Phase 1 fixes, or do you need the full audit reports in a different format?  🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

  I've identified 7 major issues that need immediate attention. Let me walk through them systematically.

  ISSUE #1: 🔴 MASSIVE SAVINGS CALCULATION DISCREPANCY

  The Problem

  The AI returns TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT savings figures:

  Initial AI Summary (Console Line 209):
  "annual_savings": 3487.5,
  "monthly_savings": 290.63,
  "savings_percentage": 0.77

  Detailed Breakdown (Console Lines 241-251):
  "total_mfn_duties_without_usmca": 98625,
  "total_duties_with_usmca": 22500,
  "net_annual_savings": 75375,  ← CONTRADICTS the initial value
  "monthly_savings": 6281.25,
  "savings_as_percentage_of_trade": 16.75

  User-Facing Display Shows: $75,375 ✓ (matches the detailed breakdown)

  The Logic Error

  The AI calculated savings twice with different methods:

  1. Quick calculation (probably only Mexican rubber):
    - $225,000 × 2.5% = $5,625
    - Then added a few other components
    - Got $3,487.50 total
  2. Detailed calculation (complete breakdown):
    - Chinese steel savings: $69,750
    - Mexican rubber savings: $5,625
    - US bolts savings: $0
    - Total: $75,375

  This is a 21.6x difference! The AI knows the right answer ($75,375) but showed a wrong answer first ($3,487.50).

  Root Cause

  The AI response contains conflicting calculation methodologies. The initial summary didn't account for the Section 301 tariff implications on Chinese steel ($69,750 savings), but the
  detailed breakdown did.

  Fix Required

  - Ensure AI returns ONE consistent savings figure in the initial summary
  - The summary should match the detailed breakdown exactly
  - Currently the API returns both, but the front-end might display the wrong one if it takes the initial summary

  Severity: HIGH - Users could see different savings amounts on different screens

  ---
  ISSUE #2: 🔴 TARIFF RATE CONFUSION (2.9% vs 77.5% + 25%)

  The Problem

  What User Sees (Lines 129-142):
  Component: Cold-rolled steel housing with powder-coated finish
  Origin: China
  MFN Rate: 2.9%
  USMCA Rate: 2.9%
  Savings: 0.0%
  Status: ✗ Non-USMCA

  What AI Actually Calculated (Console Lines 218-223):
  "mfn_rate": 77.5,
  "section_301_rate": 25,
  "combined_rate_without_usmca": 102.5%
  "usmca_base_savings": 69750,

  The Logical Problem

  These are NOT the same thing:
  - 2.9% = The HS code 7326.90.85 base MFN rate (correct HS classification)
  - 102.5% = MFN (77.5%) + Section 301 (25%) + possible other duties

  The display is showing the WRONG tariff rate to the user.

  The user sees "MFN: 2.9%, USMCA: 2.9%, Savings: 0.0%" which implies:
  - "This component is duty-free, no savings from USMCA"

  But the AI actually calculated:
  - "This component pays 102.5% in duties, USMCA saves you 77.5 percentage points = $69,750/year"

  Why This Matters

  The user is getting the RIGHT financial answer ($75,375 savings) but the WRONG explanation. If they look at component-level tariffs, they'll think Chinese steel has no tariff impact.

  Root Cause

  The tariff enrichment pipeline is pulling the base HS code rate (2.9%) but not including Section 301 or other policy tariffs in the component-level display. However, the USMCA analysis is     
  correctly including them in savings calculations.

  This is a data model mismatch:
  - Component tariff display: Shows base HS code only
  - USMCA savings calculation: Includes Section 301
  - Result: User sees 2.9% rate but system calculates $69,750 savings from it

  Fix Required

  // WRONG - what it currently shows
  Component Display:
  - MFN Rate: 2.9% (base HS code only)
  - Savings: $0

  // RIGHT - what it should show
  Component Display:
  - MFN Rate: 2.9% (base)
  - Section 301: +25% (policy tariff)
  - Total Rate: 27.9% (or 102.5% without USMCA)
  - USMCA eliminates base rate: Saves $69,750

  Severity: HIGH - User has correct final answer but wrong component understanding

  ---
  ISSUE #3: 🔴 REACT CONTROLLED COMPONENT WARNING

  Console Lines 2-29:
  Warning: A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled.
  This is likely caused by the value changing from undefined to a defined value

  The Problem

  In ComponentOriginsStepEnhanced.js, there's an input field that:
  1. Initial render: Value is undefined (uncontrolled input)
  2. Later render: Value becomes a string (controlled input)
  3. React complains: "You can't switch between uncontrolled and controlled"

  Why It Matters

  This causes form unreliability:
  - Input might not sync with component state
  - User input might not save correctly
  - Form state might get out of sync with display

  Root Cause

  Likely pattern:
  // WRONG
  <input
    value={manufactureLocation} // undefined on first render, string later
    onChange={(e) => setManufactureLocation(e.target.value)}
  />

  // RIGHT
  <input
    value={manufactureLocation || ''} // Always defined
    onChange={(e) => setManufactureLocation(e.target.value)}
  />

  Or the state initialization is missing:
  // WRONG
  const [manufactureLocation, setManufactureLocation] = useState();

  // RIGHT
  const [manufactureLocation, setManufactureLocation] = useState('');

  Severity: MEDIUM - Form works but is unreliable

  ISSUE #4: 🔴 CERTIFICATE COMPANY NAME MISMATCH

  Critical Data Inconsistency:

  What User Entered (Lines 4-9):
  Company Name: AutoParts USA Inc
  Company Country: United States
  Business Type: IMPORTER

  What Certificate Shows (Lines 47, 296, 360):
  2. CERTIFIER NAME: Test USA Exporter Inc 6
  ADDRESS: 123 Main St, Toronto, ON, M1M 1M1
  COUNTRY: Canada

  12b. COMPANY: Test USA Exporter Inc 6

  The Problem

  The certificate is showing test data instead of the user's actual company information.

  Why This Is Critical

  A USMCA Certificate of Origin with wrong company details is:
  1. Invalid - CBP won't accept it
  2. Fraudulent - Knowingly signing false certifications can trigger audits or penalties
  3. Unusable - Customer (Ford Motor Company) can't use it

  The Logic

  User is AutoParts USA Inc (IMPORTER):
  - Entry country: Mexico
  - Destination: United States
  - Role: Importer

  But certificate shows:
  - Exporter: Test USA Exporter Inc 6 (test data)
  - Importer: Ford Motor Company (hardcoded)
  - Producer: Test USA Exporter Inc 6 (test data)

  Fix Required

  // Detect certifier type based on company location
  const company_country = 'United States'; // AutoParts USA Inc
  const destination_country = 'United States';
  const supplier_country = 'Mexico';

  // Logic
  if (company_country === destination_country) {
    // US company importing from Mexico → IMPORTER
    certifier_type = 'IMPORTER';
    certifier_info = use_company_from_step1;
  } else if (company_country === supplier_country) {
    // Mexico company exporting to US → EXPORTER
    certifier_type = 'EXPORTER';
    certifier_info = use_company_from_step1;
  }

  Currently it's hardcoded to "Test USA Exporter Inc 6" which is WRONG

  Severity: CRITICAL - Certificate is fraudulent as-is

  ISSUE #5: 🟡 DATABASE SCHEMA COLUMN ERROR

  Console Lines 138-141:
  ⚠️ Failed to save 7326.90.85: Could not find the 'confidence' column
     of 'tariff_rates_cache' in the schema cache
  ⚠️ Failed to save 4016.93.10: Could not find the 'confidence' column
     of 'tariff_rates_cache' in the schema cache
  ⚠️ Failed to save 7308.90.60: Could not find the 'confidence' column
     of 'tariff_rates_cache' in the schema cache
  ✅ Successfully saved 3 AI tariff rates to database → US

  The Problem

  The code is trying to save a confidence column that doesn't exist in the database schema, but then claims to have saved successfully anyway.

  The Logic Issue

  This is a contradiction:
  - Can't find column → can't save
  - But then: Successfully saved

  One of these is lying.

  Root Cause

  In tariff_rates_cache table (per CLAUDE.md line 368-383), the columns are:
  - mfn_rate, base_mfn_rate, section_301, section_232, total_rate
  - usmca_rate, savings_percentage, policy_adjustments
  - ai_confidence (0.0-1.0)
  - cache_source, expires_at, last_updated

  The code is trying to save a field called confidence but the table has ai_confidence. Case mismatch or field name mismatch.

  Fix Required

  Either:
  1. Fix the save operation to use ai_confidence instead of confidence
  2. Or add the confidence column to the schema if it's intentionally separate

  Severity: MEDIUM - Data might not be saving correctly, but system masks the error

  ISSUE #6: 🟡 AI VALIDATION WARNING - INCORRECT FLAGGING

  Console Lines 341-376:
  ⚠️ AI VALIDATION WARNING: AI claimed tariff rates not found in cache: [
       20,    25, 102.5,
       25,    50,    30,
    16.75, 21.92,    25
  ]

  And again at lines 495-620:
  ⚠️ AI VALIDATION WARNING (ALERTS): AI claimed tariff rates not found
     in component cache: [ 50, 50, 15, 102.5, 75, 50 ]

  The Problem

  The validation is flagging the WRONG things as tariff rates:

  | Value | What It Actually Is                        | Should Flag?              |
  |-------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
  | 20    | Component percentage (product composition) | ❌ NO                      |
  | 25    | Section 301 rate OR component %            | ❌ ONLY if 25% Section 301 |
  | 102.5 | RVC percentage (USMCA threshold)           | ❌ NO                      |
  | 50    | Component percentage (MX rubber)           | ❌ NO                      |
  | 30    | Component percentage (US bolts)            | ❌ NO                      |
  | 16.75 | Savings percentage                         | ❌ NO                      |
  | 21.92 | Effective duty rate                        | ✅ YES, maybe flag         |
  | 75    | RVC threshold requirement                  | ❌ NO                      |

  Why This Is Wrong

  The validation function is a false positive generator. It's checking:
  if (number_from_ai_response === number_in_cache) {
    log("✅ Found in cache");
  } else {
    log("⚠️ NOT found in cache");
  }

  But it's not distinguishing between:
  - Tariff rates (should be in cache): 2.9%, 2.5%, 0%, 77.5%
  - Calculated values (should NOT be in cache): 50%, 75%, 102.5%, 16.75%, 21.92%
  - Component percentages (should NOT be in cache): 20%, 50%, 30%

  Fix Required

  // WRONG - current implementation
  const validation_numbers = [20, 25, 102.5, 25, 50, 30, 16.75, 21.92, 25];
  if (!cache_has(validation_numbers)) {
    log("⚠️ Not found");
  }

  // RIGHT - what it should do
  const tariff_rates_to_validate = [2.9, 2.5, 0, 77.5]; // Only actual rates
  const rvc_percentages_to_validate = [50, 30, 22.5, 102.5]; // Component %
  const derived_metrics = [16.75, 21.92, 75]; // Don't validate these

  // Only validate tariff rates against cache
  tariff_rates_to_validate.forEach(rate => {
    if (!cache_has(rate)) log("⚠️ tariff rate not in cache");
  });

  // Validate RVC percentages sum to 100%
  if (rvc_percentages_to_validate.sum() !== 102.5) {
    log("⚠️ RVC breakdown doesn't match total");
  }

  Severity: LOW - False warnings but core functionality works

  ISSUE #7: 🟡 ALERT SYSTEM MISSING WORKFLOW CONTEXT

  Console Lines 488-491:
  ✅ Found workflow intelligence: 0 recommendations, 0 analysis sections
  ✅ Found workflow intelligence: 0 recommendations, 0 analysis sections
  ✅ Found workflow intelligence: 0 recommendations, 0 analysis sections
  ✅ Found workflow intelligence: 0 recommendations, 0 analysis sections

  The Problem

  The alert generation system is creating 5 personalized alerts (Line 477) but can't access the workflow USMCA analysis to provide context.

  Why It Matters

  Alerts are being created without workflow intelligence:
  - Alert content: AI-generated generic text
  - Alert context: Missing user's specific USMCA analysis, RVC numbers, components
  - Alert relevance: Reduced because no personalization from actual workflow

  Example from console (Line 512):
  "broker_summary_preview": "Good news for once: Mexico is expanding natural rubber
  processing capacity specifically for automotive applications. You're already
  USMCA-qualified at 102.5% (well above the 75% threshold)..."

  The AI knows about the 102.5% and 75% threshold because it's in the prompt, not because it retrieved the workflow analysis.

  Root Cause

  The workflow results are being stored (Line 398):
  ✅ Workflow saved to database for user: 570206c8-b431-4936-81e8-8186ea4065f0

  But the alert consolidation endpoint is not finding them (Lines 488-491).

  Possible reasons:
  1. Timing issue: Alerts generated before workflow fully saved
  2. Data access issue: Alert endpoint can't query workflow table
  3. Schema mismatch: Workflow intelligence structure doesn't match alert expectations

  Fix Required

  The alert system should:
  // Step 1: Fetch the user's most recent workflow
  const workflow = await getLatestWorkflow(userId);

  // Step 2: Extract context
  const context = {
    rvc_percentage: workflow.enrichment_data.north_american_content,
    rvc_threshold: workflow.enrichment_data.threshold_applied,
    components: workflow.enrichment_data.component_breakdown,
    qualified: workflow.usmca_qualified,
    savings: workflow.enrichment_data.savings.annual_savings
  };

  // Step 3: Pass to alert consolidation with context
  const alerts = await consolidateAlerts(userId, context);

  Severity: MEDIUM - Alerts work but lack personalization

  🎯 AI USAGE ASSESSMENT

  ✅ What AI Is Doing Right

  1. Correct USMCA qualification determination - Logic is sound (102.5% > 75%)
  2. Accurate component classification - HS codes 7326.90.85, 4016.93.10, 7308.90.60 are correct
  3. Proper Section 301 analysis - Recognizes Chinese steel has Section 301 tariffs
  4. Detailed explanations - VERY clear business reasoning in detailed analysis
  5. Confidence scoring - 95% confidence is appropriate
  6. Complete documentation - Lists all required documents for compliance

  ❌ What AI Is Getting Wrong

  1. Inconsistent initial savings - Says $3,487.50 then $75,375
  2. Confused field naming - Calls "net_savings: 0" while explaining $69,750 savings
  3. Missing TwoTier validation - Doesn't validate both calculations against each other
  4. Component-level tariff confusion - Using base rates in one place, Section 301 rates in another
  5. Alert content without workflow - Generating alerts with numbers that should come from workflow

  🔧 How to Fix AI Usage

  In the USMCA analysis prompt:
  // ADD THIS VALIDATION
  "output_validation": {
    "rule_1": "initial_savings_summary MUST equal detailed_breakdown total",
    "rule_2": "all_tariff_rates_used must include Section_301 for China components",
    "rule_3": "component_display_rates must equal rates_used_in_calculations",
    "rule_4": "net_savings must be positive if savings_explanation says positive"
  }

  // ADD THIS CALCULATION CHECK
  if (initial_savings !== detailed_savings) {
    throw new Error(
      `Savings mismatch: initial=$${initial_savings}, detailed=$${detailed_savings}`
    );
  }

  // ADD THIS RATE VALIDATION
  const component_1_rate_summary = 2.9;  // What's shown to user
  const component_1_rate_calculation = 102.5;  // What's used in math
  if (component_1_rate_summary !== component_1_rate_calculation) {
    throw new Error(
      `Rate mismatch: display=${component_1_rate_summary}, calc=${component_1_rate_calculation}`
    );
  }

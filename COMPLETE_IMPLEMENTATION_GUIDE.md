## Implementation Steps for Each Service

### Step 1: Verify AI Output Stage (20 mins)

Check what Stage 2 currently displays. Does it show:
- **For Cristina**: Classification results, compliance analysis, risk assessment?
- **For Jorge**: Supplier lists, location recommendations, market contacts?

If Jorge's services show classification validation instead of supplier discovery, the AI API call is wrong.

### Step 2: Add Expert Input Form (30 mins)

Add the specific fields listed above for each service. Use the exact placeholders shown.

### Step 3: Fix Report API Prompts (30 mins)

**For Cristina's reports**:
```javascript
const prompt = `You are Cristina, Licensed Customs Broker #4601913 with 17 years experience.

CLIENT DATA:
Company: ${companyName}
Product: ${productDescription}
Trade Volume: $${tradeVolume}
Component Origins: ${componentOrigins}

YOUR PROFESSIONAL ANALYSIS:
${expertInput}

Generate compliance validation report with:
- Actual tariff calculations
- USMCA qualification analysis
- Specific audit defense requirements
- Your professional validation in first person`;
```

**For Jorge's reports**:
```javascript
const prompt = `You are Jorge, B2B sales expert with 4+ years at CCVIAL and Mexico business network.

CLIENT NEEDS:
Company: ${companyName}
Product: ${productDescription}
Current Sourcing: ${currentSourcing}

SUPPLIERS/LOCATIONS YOU IDENTIFIED:

```

### Step 4: Test End-to-End (10 mins)

1. Open dashboard
2. Start service workflow  
3. Fill expert input fields
4. Generate report
5. Check email for report
6. Verify report contains specific contacts/recommendations, not generic advice

---

## Critical Rules

**DO**:
- Keep Cristina's services focused on compliance validation
- Keep Jorge's services focused on business contact discovery
- Include expert input verbatim in reports
- Use actual client data in calculations
- Write expert sections in first person

**DON'T**:
- Copy Cristina's validation pattern to Jorge's services
- Let Jorge's services output compliance reports instead of supplier lists
- Allow generic "comprehensive strategy" without specifics
- Let reports say "undefined" or "cannot be determined"

---

## Success Criteria

**Cristina's reports should read like**: Professional customs broker validation with specific compliance risks and audit defense strategy

**Jorge's reports should read like**: B2B sales executive providing specific Mexico supplier contacts and relationship building plans

If Jorge's reports look like compliance validation, you've applied the wrong pattern.

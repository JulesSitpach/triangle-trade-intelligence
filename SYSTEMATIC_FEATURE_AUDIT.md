# Systematic Feature Audit - Triangle Intelligence Platform
**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Purpose:** Proactive feature validation to prevent discovering broken functionality accidentally

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. Email Notification System - **COMPLETELY BROKEN**

**Status:** ‚ùå NON-FUNCTIONAL

**Issues Found:**
1. **Missing API Key**: `RESEND_API_KEY` not configured in `.env.local`
2. **Missing Database Column**: `email_notifications` column doesn't exist in `user_profiles` table
3. **Code/Schema Mismatch**: `resend-alert-service.js:312` queries non-existent column

**Impact:**
- RSS feeds create alerts successfully ‚úÖ
- BUT emails never sent to users ‚ùå
- Users don't know about critical trade alerts ‚ùå
- Retention mechanism completely broken ‚ùå

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// From resend-alert-service.js line 312
.eq('email_notifications', true)  // ‚ùå Column doesn't exist
```

**Database Schema (actual):**
```sql
-- user_profiles table has NO email_notifications column
-- Columns: id, company_name, email, status, subscription_tier, workflow_completions,
-- certificates_generated, total_savings, created_at, updated_at, last_login,
-- industry, company_size, phone, address_*, is_admin, role, user_id, full_name,
-- user_email, trade_volume, terms_accepted_at, privacy_accepted_at, password_hash,
-- stripe_customer_id, referred_by, referral_*, trial_ends_at
```

**Fixes Required:**
1. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to `.env.local` (should already be in Vercel production environment)
2. Add migration to create `email_notifications` column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles
ADD COLUMN email_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```
3. Update account settings page to allow users to toggle email preferences
4. Test end-to-end email flow

## ‚úÖ WORKING FEATURES

### RSS Feed Polling System - **NOW WORKING**
**Status:** ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL (Fixed October 20, 2025)

**What Works:**
- RSS cron configured in `vercel.json` (every 2 hours)
- Manual trigger via `/api/cron/rss-polling` works
- 2 active feeds producing 210+ items:
  - Trump 2.0 Tariff Tracker
  - Federal Register Trade Documents
- Crisis detection creates alerts successfully (8 new alerts created)
- Database inserts working correctly after schema fixes

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Email notifications (see Critical Issue #1 above)
- Unknown if Vercel cron is actually triggering in production (not tested)

**Recent Fixes (October 20):**
- Fixed `alert_type` to use allowed values (tariff_change, trade_disruption, etc.)
- Fixed `confidence_score` to use 0-1 decimal range
- Fixed column name `requires_attention` ‚Üí `requires_action`
- Removed non-existent columns (keywords_matched, crisis_score, source_url, etc.)
- Added `determineAlertType()`, `extractHSCodes()`, `extractCountries()` helpers

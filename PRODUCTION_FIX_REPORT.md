## Executive Summary

Fixed **6 critical data flow issues** preventing proper certificate generation and alert calculation. All company data now flows correctly through the workflow.

---

## Issues Fixed

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix | Impact |
|-------|-----------|-----|--------|
| **Empty certificate country fields** | `company_country` not passed to certificate generator | Added to workflowData in both Authorization steps | Certificates now include exporter/producer/importer countries |
| **Missing trade volume in alerts** | Trade volume not included in API response | Added to result.company object | Alerts can now calculate impact, shows actual volumes |
| **Database column mismatches** | Code inserting to non-existent columns | Fixed column name: `issue_data` → `context_data` | Error logging now works |
| **Missing business columns** | `workflow_completions` table missing fields | Created migration adding 6 columns | Complete business data persists to DB |
| **React Hook warnings** | Missing `components` dependency | Added to useEffect dependency array | Eliminates console warning |
| **Validation too permissive** | Only checked for missing, not empty strings | Added `.trim() === ''` check | Prevents invalid certificate generation |

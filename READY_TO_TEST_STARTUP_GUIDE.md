## 🎯 WHERE TO TEST FIRST (5 PRIORITY TESTS)

### ✅ Test 1: Complete Workflow End-to-End (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**File**: END_TO_END_ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md → Test 1
**Steps**:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/usmca-workflow
2. Complete Step 1: Enter company info + destination country (e.g., US)
3. Complete Step 2: Add components with origins (e.g., PCB from China = triggers Section 301)
4. Complete Step 3: Review results
5. Click "Save to Database" at results
6. Go to Dashboard (http://localhost:3001/dashboard)
7. Verify all data loaded correctly
8. Click "Set up Alerts" → Verify alerts page loads with your products
9. Verify personalized alerts are filtered by your industry

**What to Look For**:
- ✅ All component enrichment preserved (HS codes, tariff rates, savings %)
- ✅ Financial data consistent across all sections
- ✅ Section 301 shown as RED SEPARATE badge (not in base duty)
- ✅ Mexico sourcing option shows DYNAMIC cost (not hardcoded "+2%")
- ✅ Alerts filtering by your industry

**Expected Result**: All data flows through system without loss or hardcoding

---

### ✅ Test 2: China Component Section 301 Verification
**File**: END_TO_END_ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md → Test 3
**Steps**:
1. Create workflow with **Chinese-origin component** (e.g., PCB board, HS 8517.62)
2. Check USMCAQualification results page
3. Verify component shows:
   - Base MFN rate (e.g., 2.5%)
   - Section 301 badge in RED showing actual rate (e.g., 10%, not hardcoded 25%)
   - Total rate calculated correctly
4. Check TariffSavings section
5. Verify Section 301 burden shown in red box (e.g., "$43,750/year")
6. Check RecommendedActions mentions Section 301 exposure
7. Check Mexico sourcing alternative cost shows DYNAMIC value (not "+2%")

**What to Look For**:
- ✅ Section 301 rate varies by HS code (not all 25%)
- ✅ Different Chinese products show different Section 301 rates
- ✅ Mexico sourcing payback varies by product complexity (not hardcoded 3 months)
- ✅ Timeline varies by product (not hardcoded 4-6 weeks)

**Expected Result**: Dynamic values based on your specific product, not generic assumptions

---

### ✅ Test 3: Mexico Nearshoring ROI Calculation
**File**: END_TO_END_ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md → Test 3 & END_TO_END_ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md → Test 1
**Steps**:
1. Use same China component workflow
2. In RecommendedActions section, check Mexico sourcing alternative
3. Verify shows:
   - Cost premium specific to YOUR industry (e.g., aerospace = +17%, electronics = +2%)
   - Implementation timeline specific to product complexity (e.g., high complexity = 20 weeks)
   - Setup cost realistic for your industry (e.g., aerospace = $45K, not hardcoded $7.5K)
   - Payback period CALCULATED, not hardcoded 3 months
4. Use formula to verify: `payback_months = setup_cost / (monthly_tariff_savings - monthly_premium_cost)`

**What to Look For**:
- ✅ Cost premium varies by industry sector (NOT all "+2%")
- ✅ Timeline varies by complexity (NOT all "4-6 weeks")
- ✅ Setup cost realistic for industry (NOT all "$7,500")
- ✅ Payback changes with trade volume (higher volume = faster payback)
- ✅ Each industry shows different ROI

**Expected Result**: Accurate, personalized ROI timeline for nearshoring decision

---

### ✅ Test 4: Certificate Generation Validation
**File**: END_TO_END_ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md → Test 2
**Steps**:
1. Complete workflow with QUALIFIED product (RVC ≥ industry threshold)
2. Go to Results → CertificateSection
3. Verify required fields present:
   - ✅ Company name (from Step 1)
   - ✅ Company country (CRITICAL - must be filled in Step 1)
   - ✅ Product HS code (from AI classification)
4. Click "Download Certificate"
5. Verify PDF generates with:
   - Company data matches Step 1 input
   - Product HS code matches AI classification
   - Regional content % matches USMCA calculation
   - Preference criterion (A/B/C/D) shows correctly (NEVER defaults to 'B')
6. Try WITHOUT filling company.country in Step 1 → Should error (validation working)

**What to Look For**:
- ✅ Company.country is REQUIRED (blocks generation if missing)
- ✅ Preference criterion comes from AI response (not defaulted)
- ✅ PDF contains all USMCA Form D fields
- ✅ Clear error message if required data missing

**Expected Result**: Only qualified products generate valid certificates with proper validation

---

### ✅ Test 5: Personalized Alerts Relevance Filtering
**File**: END_TO_END_ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md → Test 4
**Steps**:
1. After saving workflow, go to trade-risk-alternatives.js (Alerts page)
2. Verify personalized alerts are FILTERED (not all 5 generic alerts shown)
3. Check top 3 alerts are sorted by relevance score
4. Verify each alert shows:
   - Relevance score (Green ≥80%, Amber 60-79%, Gray <60%)
   - Reason why relevant (e.g., "Affects Electronics, matches your PCB sourcing")
   - Financial impact specific to YOUR business (e.g., "$43K exposure if Section 301 increases")
5. Compare 2 different industries:
   - Electronics user → Should see different alerts than Aerospace user
   - Chemistry user → Different alerts again
6. Compare 2 different suppliers:
   - China supplier → High Section 301 relevance
   - Mexico supplier → Lower Section 301 relevance

**What to Look For**:
- ✅ Alerts filtered by industry (not showing all alerts to all users)
- ✅ Alerts filtered by supplier geography (China vs Mexico shows different relevance)
- ✅ Financial impact calculated for YOUR business size (not generic)
- ✅ Relevance scoring visible and makes sense
- ✅ Top 3 alerts are actually most relevant (not random)

**Expected Result**: Only personalized, relevant alerts shown with correct financial impact

## 🔍 CRITICAL VALIDATIONS (MUST CHECK)

### 1. Section 301 Is NOT Hardcoded to 25%
- [ ] Chinese component shows different rates based on HS code
- [ ] Semiconductor (HS 8471) shows ~10% Section 301 (NOT 25%)
- [ ] Apparel (HS 6203) shows ~25% Section 301 (actual assignment)
- [ ] Different products = different Section 301 rates

### 2. Mexico Cost Premium Is NOT Hardcoded to +2%
- [ ] Electronics shows +1-3% premium
- [ ] Aerospace shows +15-20% premium
- [ ] Textiles might show -5% (cheaper, not more expensive)
- [ ] Cost varies by industry (different for each user's sector)

### 3. Payback Period Is CALCULATED, NOT Hardcoded to 3 Months
- [ ] $1M volume → different payback than $10M volume
- [ ] High Section 301 exposure → faster payback
- [ ] Low Section 301 exposure → slower payback
- [ ] Higher setup cost → longer payback
- [ ] Each scenario shows DIFFERENT payback, not all "3 months"

### 4. Thresholds Are By Industry, NOT Hardcoded to 60%
- [ ] Automotive shows ~75% threshold (NOT 60%)
- [ ] Electronics shows ~60% threshold
- [ ] Chemicals shows ~50% threshold (NOT 60%)
- [ ] Different industries = different thresholds

### 5. Company.Country Field Is REQUIRED for Certificate
- [ ] Leaving company.country empty in Step 1 → Certificate blocks with error
- [ ] No silent defaults, no fake data generation
- [ ] Clear error message: "Company country is required"

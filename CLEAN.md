Perfect! I can see your Triangle project. Let me access it correctly:I can see this is definitely a complex project with lots of documentation files from previous agents. Let me first check the core structure - the components and API files that actually matter for launch:Perfect! Now let me check what Cristina and Jorge's components look like:Now I can give you a **SAFE CLEANUP STRATEGY** to launch today:

## ðŸš¨ SAFE CLEANUP PLAN (Launch Today)

### Step 1: Test Current State First
Before touching anything, let's see what actually works:

```bash
cd D:\bacjup\triangle-simple
npm run dev
```

Open each dashboard and test the 6 core services:
- Cristina: HS Classification, USMCA Certificate, Crisis Response  
- Jorge: Supplier Sourcing, Manufacturing Feasibility, Market Entry

### Step 2: Crisis Response 400 Error Fix
Let me check if the API endpoint mismatch exists:I can see this component exists. Let me search for where the Crisis Response API call happens (likely in a fetch to `/api/crisis-calculator`):Let me use the filesystem tools to search:Great! The API file exists. Let me check if there's a mismatch between what components call vs what exists:Now let me check if there's an API endpoint mismatch. Let me see what the Crisis Response component actually calls:Let me use the correct approach:I found the issue! This component is calling `/api/crisis-response-analysis` in Stage 2, but let me check what API files actually exist for crisis services:Great! The endpoint `crisis-response-analysis` actually DOES exist. Let me check what's in it to see if it's properly implemented:So the API exists. Let me see if there's a networking or data structure issue. Let me also check the current working reference - HS Classification:Now let me check what the `.env.local` file looks like to see if there are any environment variable issues:Great! Environment variables look good. Now let me give you my **STRATEGIC CLEANUP ADVICE**:

## ðŸš¨ **SAFE LAUNCH STRATEGY** - Clean Without Breaking

### **Phase 1: Test Current State (5 minutes)**
```bash
cd D:\bacjup\triangle-simple
npm run dev
```

**Test exactly these 6 services in browser:**
1. HS Classification (should work - this is your reference)
2. USMCA Certificate  
3. Crisis Response
4. Supplier Sourcing
5. Manufacturing Feasibility  
6. Market Entry

### **Phase 2: Identify Actual Problems (10 minutes)**

**For each broken service, check:**
- Does it load Stage 1? (If no: component issue)
- Does Stage 2 AI call work? (If no: API endpoint issue)  
- Does final report generate? (If no: email/generation issue)

### **Phase 3: Safe Fixes Only (30 minutes max)**

**Crisis Response 400 Error:**
- Component calls `crisis-response-analysis` âœ“ (exists)
- BUT check if the component sends the right data structure
- DON'T rewrite - just fix the data mismatch

**Data Showing "undefined":**
- Check if `request?.company_name` vs `serviceDetails?.company_name` 
- Simple find/replace to match HS Classification pattern
- Don't refactor the whole data structure

### **CRITICAL CLEANUP RULES:**

**DO:**
- Test ONE service completely before moving to next
- Copy working patterns from HS Classification
- Keep all environment variables as-is
- Only fix obvious API call mismatches

**DON'T:**
- Delete any files (even if they look messy)
- Change working HS Classification component
- Refactor the data structure 
- Clean up documentation files during launch day

### **Safe File Operations:**

1. **Backup first:** Copy the working HS Classification as reference
2. **Test incrementally:** Fix one component â†’ test â†’ move to next  
3. **Rollback plan:** If you break something, revert that one file

### **Launch Decision Point:**

**Launch with 4+ working services** rather than delay for perfect cleanup.

The mess of files isn't blocking launch - only broken API calls and undefined data are.

What's your current service test results? Start with HS Classification to confirm your reference works, then test the others in order of importance.

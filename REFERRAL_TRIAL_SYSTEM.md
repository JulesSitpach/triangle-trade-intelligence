  COUNT(*) as total_signups,
  SUM(CASE WHEN referral_converted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as converted,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN referral_converted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as conversion_rate
FROM user_profiles
WHERE referred_by IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY referred_by;
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Files Created**:

2. `/pages/signup/referral.js` - Referral signup page
3. `/pages/api/auth/signup-referral.js` - Referral signup API

### **How It Works**:
1. User clicks referral link (`?ref=adam` or `?ref=anthony`)
2. Signup page shows referrer badge and 30-day trial info
3. On submit, API creates user with:
   - `subscription_tier: 'Professional'`
   - `status: 'trial'`
   - `trial_end_date: +30 days`
   - `referred_by: 'Adam Williams'` or `'Anthony Robinson'`
4. User auto-logged in (no email confirmation needed for trials)
5. Redirect to dashboard with full Professional access

### **Database Columns Added**:
```sql
referred_by TEXT              -- "Adam Williams" or "Anthony Robinson"
referral_source TEXT          -- "linkedin"
referral_date TIMESTAMPTZ     -- When they signed up
referral_converted BOOLEAN    -- false until they pay
referral_converted_date       -- When they converted to paid
```

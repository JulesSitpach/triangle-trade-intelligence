Qualification unlocks B USMCA preference. China-origin components expose you to policy risk. Mexico sourcing at +2-3% cost premium eliminates Section 301 tariffs and increases RVC buffer. Typical payback: 3-6 months. Strong RVC position (8% buffer). Stable qualification unless supply chain changes.

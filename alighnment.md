Yes! After fixing the field alignment, here are the **OTHER CRITICAL ALIGNMENTS** to check:

## üîç **ADDITIONAL ALIGNMENT CHECKS**

### **1. Email Template Alignment**
**Check**: Do the email templates use the new professional field names?
- Location: `pages/api/generate-*-report.js` files
- Risk: Report emails might show "undefined" even if API accepts the fields
- Fix: Update email templates to reference correct field names

### **2. Database Schema Alignment** 
**Check**: Do database tables have columns for the new field names?
- Risk: Data might not save properly even if API accepts it
- Test: Check if completed workflows actually store the expert inputs
- Fix: Add database columns or update field mapping

### **3. Stage Data Flow Alignment**
**Check**: Do Stages 1‚Üí2‚Üí3 pass data correctly between components?
- Risk: Stage 3 might not receive Stage 1 client data
- Symptom: "undefined" company names or trade volumes in final reports
- Fix: Verify `stageData` object structure matches expectations

### **4. Report Generation Template Alignment**
**Check**: Do the actual report templates format the professional inputs correctly?
- Risk: Reports generate but show placeholder text instead of real expert input
- Test: Check if final PDF/email shows Cristina's actual notes vs generic text
- Fix: Update report templates to use professional field data

### **5. Toast/Error Message Alignment**
**Check**: Do success/error messages match the new professional flow?
- Risk: Users see confusing technical error messages
- Fix: Update user-facing messages to reflect professional service completion

### **6. ServiceWorkflowModal Integration**
**Check**: Does the shared modal component handle all 6 service configurations correctly?
- Location: `components/shared/ServiceWorkflowModal.js`
- Risk: Modal might break with service-specific field requirements
- Fix: Ensure modal properly handles each service's unique structure

## **‚ö†Ô∏è MOST LIKELY ISSUES AFTER FIELD FIX:**

1. **Email templates still reference old field names** (90% chance)
2. **Stage data not flowing properly** (70% chance) 
3. **Database not storing expert inputs** (60% chance)

## **üß™ TESTING PROTOCOL AFTER FIELD FIX:**

1. **Complete one full workflow**
2. **Check email content** - Does it show real expert input?
3. **Check browser network tab** - Are API calls succeeding (200 not 400)?
4. **Check database** - Are expert inputs actually stored?
5. **Test with different sample data** - Does client info flow through correctly?

- **"undefined" in reports** ‚Üí Email template issue

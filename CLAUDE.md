## üìã Project Overview

**Triangle Intelligence Platform** - A professional USMCA compliance and certificate generation platform with hybrid SaaS + expert services model.

**Core Value**: AI-enhanced expert services for Mexico/Latin America trade bridge serving North American importers/exporters.

**Business Model**: SMB-focused tiered subscriptions ($99-599/month) + Professional services ($200-650 per service) with automatic subscriber discounts (15-25% off).

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (Pages Router), React 18
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (34,476+ HS codes)
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API with Claude models for all AI functionality
- **Styling**: Existing CSS classes only (NO Tailwind, NO inline styles)

### Development Server Port Assignment
- **Port 3000**: Reserved for USER - main development server for direct testing and console visibility
- **Port 3001**: Reserved for CLAUDE CODE agents - testing, debugging, and automated validation
- **Rationale**: User needs direct console visibility on port 3000 to see errors and debug output in real-time. Claude Code agents must use port 3001 to avoid interference.
- **Usage**: All Claude Code sessions should run `npm run dev:3001` for testing (never use `npm run dev` which uses port 3000)

### Core Principles
- **USMCA Optimization Focus**: Help North American companies maximize USMCA benefits and prepare for potential agreement changes
- **AI + Human Hybrid**: AI strategic analysis ‚Üí Human execution and relationship building
- **Mexico Trade Bridge**: Bilingual team advantage, cultural understanding, B2B sales expertise
- **Hybrid Architecture**: AI for context analysis, Config file for industry thresholds, Database for user data only - NO hardcoded fallbacks
- **Cookie-Based Auth**: HttpOnly cookies for secure session management (NOT Supabase auth tokens in localStorage)

const TIER_DISCOUNTS = {
  'Starter': 0,          // No discount
  'Professional': 0.15,  // 15% off
  'Premium': 0.25        // 25% off
};

// Calculate price with subscriber discount
const basePrice = SERVICE_PRICES[service_id];
const userTier = user.subscription_tier || 'Trial';
const discount = TIER_DISCOUNTS[userTier] || 0;

// Apply discount automatically
let servicePrice = basePrice;
if (discount > 0) {
  servicePrice = Math.round(basePrice * (1 - discount));
}
```

**Non-subscribers** pay base price (same as Starter tier).

  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
    messages: [{
      role: "user", 
      content: `BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Company: ${subscriberData.company_name}
Product: ${subscriberData.product_description}
Current USMCA Qualification: ${subscriberData.qualification_status}

## üîÑ Hybrid Architecture (USMCA Workflow)

### Architecture Decision: AI + Config File + Database

**Updated January 2025**: Implemented hybrid approach for USMCA workflow optimization.

### What Uses What:

**ü§ñ AI (OpenRouter API):**
- HS code classification (context-dependent, changes frequently)
- Product-specific remediation recommendations (requires contextual analysis)
- Tariff rate lookups (will add when database is incomplete)
- Complex business logic requiring judgment

**üìÑ Config File (`config/usmca-thresholds.js`):**
- USMCA regional content thresholds by industry (fixed by treaty)
- Official threshold sources (yarn-forward, regional value content, etc.)
- Qualification rule types (tariff shift, wholly obtained, etc.)
- Industry-specific documentation requirements

**üóÑÔ∏è Database (Supabase):**
- User data (companies, workflows, service requests)
- Component origins (user input from workflow)
- Historical workflow results for analytics
- Admin dashboard data (service completions, certificates)

### Why This Approach:

**For Early Stage (Current):**
- ‚úÖ Correct thresholds from official USMCA treaty (no database sync needed)
- ‚úÖ Product-specific AI recommendations (better than generic advice)
- ‚úÖ Fast iteration (no database migrations for threshold updates)
- ‚úÖ Low cost (~$0.005 per workflow = half a cent)

**For Scale (Future):**
- Cache common HS code requests when patterns emerge (>1000 users/month)
- Store AI-generated recommendations for reuse when costs increase
- Build Mexico supplier database when we have real usage data

### Data Flow Architecture:

```javascript
// USMCA Qualification Check Flow
1. User Input ‚Üí ComponentOriginsStepEnhanced.js
   ‚Üì
2. Form Data ‚Üí useWorkflowState hook (localStorage + database)
   ‚Üì
3. API Call ‚Üí POST /api/database-driven-usmca-compliance
   ‚Üì
4. Threshold Lookup ‚Üí config/usmca-thresholds.js (NOT database)
   ‚Üì getUSMCAThreshold(businessType, hsCode)
   ‚Üì Returns: { threshold: 55, source: 'usmca_treaty_chapter_6_yarn_forward' }
   ‚Üì
5. Calculation ‚Üí database-driven-usmca-engine.js
   ‚Üì calculateRegionalContent(components, usmcaCountries, rules)
   ‚Üì
6. If Not Qualified ‚Üí AI Recommendations
   ‚Üì OpenRouter API with full business context
   ‚Üì Prompt includes: business type, product, component descriptions
   ‚Üì Returns: ["Replace India fabric with Mexico textile mills", ...]
   ‚Üì
7. Results ‚Üí WorkflowResults.js
```

### Critical Implementation Details:

**Threshold Lookup (Fixed January 2025):**
```javascript
// database-driven-usmca-engine.js lines 91-120
async getQualificationRules(hsCode = null, businessType = null) {
  // Import config file directly (NOT database query)
  const { getUSMCAThreshold } = await import('../../config/usmca-thresholds.js');

  // Get threshold based on business type
  const thresholdData = await getUSMCAThreshold(businessType, hsCode);

  // Textiles ‚Üí 55%, Electronics ‚Üí 65%, Automotive ‚Üí 75%
  return {
    rule_type: thresholdData.rule_type,
    regional_content_threshold: thresholdData.threshold,
    source: thresholdData.source
  };
}
```

**AI Recommendations (Added January 2025):**
```javascript
// database-driven-usmca-compliance.js lines 750-859
async function generateWorkflowRecommendations(product, usmca, savings, formData) {
  if (!usmca.qualified && formData) {
    // Build component breakdown with descriptions
    const componentBreakdown = formData.component_origins
      ?.map(c => `- ${c.value_percentage}% from ${c.origin_country} (${c.description})`)
      .join('\n');

    const prompt = `You are a USMCA compliance expert...

    COMPANY CONTEXT:
    - Business Type: ${formData.business_type}
    - Product: ${formData.product_description}
    - Component Breakdown: ${componentBreakdown}

    Generate 3-4 specific recommendations to achieve USMCA qualification.
    Be specific to this product type (textiles, electronics, etc.)`;

    // Call OpenRouter API
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      model: 'anthropic/claude-3-haiku',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
    });

    // Parse AI recommendations
    const aiRecommendations = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
    return aiRecommendations;
  }
}
```

**No Fallback Data (Critical Change):**
```javascript
// All emergency fallbacks REMOVED (January 2025)
// System now fails loudly to expose missing data

// BEFORE (Wrong):
if (!rules) {
  return { threshold: 62.5, source: 'emergency_fallback' };  // ‚ùå Fake data
}

// AFTER (Correct):
if (!rules) {
  throw new Error('USMCA rules not found - config file incomplete');  // ‚úÖ Fail loudly
}
```

### Cost Analysis:

**Per Workflow:**
- HS code classification: ~$0.003 (Claude Haiku)
- AI recommendations (if not qualified): ~$0.002 (Claude Haiku)
- Total: **~$0.005 per workflow**

**Monthly Estimates:**
- 100 users: $0.50/month (negligible)
- 1,000 users: $5/month (still cheap)
- 10,000 users: $50/month (time to add caching)

**When to Migrate to Full Database:**
- Database caching when AI costs >$50/month
- Store common HS code patterns for reuse
- Cache AI recommendations for similar products

  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  subscriber_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Service completions table (NEEDS CREATION)
CREATE TABLE service_completions (

### Critical Configuration
- **`.env.local`** - Environment variables (Supabase, OpenRouter)
- **`styles/globals.css`** - Global styles
- **`styles/admin-workflows.css`** - Admin dashboard styles

### Anti-Hardcoding Rules (CRITICAL)
**‚õî NEVER HARDCODE:**
- Company names, country codes, business types
- Trade volumes, HS codes, tariff rates
- Product descriptions, addresses, phone numbers
- Any business data that should come from subscriber workflow

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH:**
- Use subscriber_data from service requests
- Pull data from localStorage: `workflowData?.company?.name`
- Configuration-driven defaults only

## üìö Implementation Templates

### Service Request Card Template
```javascript
<div className="service-request-card">
  <h3>{serviceType} - {request.client_company}</h3>
  <p>Product: {request.subscriber_data.product_description}</p>
  <p>USMCA Status: {request.subscriber_data.qualification_status}</p>
  <p>Trade Volume: ${request.subscriber_data.trade_volume}</p>
  <button onClick={() => startWorkflow(request)} className="btn-primary">
    Start {serviceType}
  </button>
</div>
```

### OpenRouter API Call Template
```javascript
const analyzeWithAI = async (subscriberData, serviceContext) => {
  const prompt = `BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Company: ${subscriberData.company_name}
Product: ${subscriberData.product_description}
Current USMCA Status: ${subscriberData.qualification_status}
Annual Trade Volume: $${subscriberData.trade_volume}

SERVICE REQUEST: ${serviceContext}

Provide strategic analysis and recommendations.`;

  const response = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
    })
  });

  return await response.json();
};
```

### When Do Users Need Services?

**Path 1: USMCA Analysis shows "NOT QUALIFIED"**
- User discovers they can't use USMCA benefits
- They need help: "How do I restructure my supply chain?"
- **Jorge's services:** Find Mexico suppliers, set up manufacturing there
- Goal: Restructure to BECOME qualified

**Path 2: Trade Risk Alerts trigger**
- User gets alert: "Tariffs increasing on Chinese components"
- They're currently qualified but at risk
- **Jorge's services:** Find alternative suppliers to maintain qualification
- **Cristina's services:** Crisis response, compliance help

**Path 3: User is qualified but wants optimization**
- Certificate generated successfully
- But they see potential savings with better sourcing
- **Jorge's services:** Find cheaper Mexico suppliers
- Maintain qualification while reducing costs

The services are for **fixing problems** or **optimization**, not for people who are already compliant and happy.

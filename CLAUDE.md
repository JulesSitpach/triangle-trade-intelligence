## ü§ñ AI Integration Strategy

### OpenRouter API Integration (Current Reality)
**All AI functionality uses OpenRouter API with Claude models:**

```javascript
// Standard API pattern for all services
const response = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
    messages: [{
      role: "user", 
      content: `BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Company: ${subscriberData.company_name}
Product: ${subscriberData.product_description}
Current USMCA Qualification: ${subscriberData.qualification_status}
Annual Trade Volume: $${subscriberData.trade_volume}

TASK: ${serviceSpecificPrompt}`
    }]
  })
});
```

### AI Service Applications
**USMCA Certificate Generation**: OpenRouter API for classification verification
**HS Code Validation**: OpenRouter API for regulatory compliance analysis
**Crisis Response**: OpenRouter API for impact analysis and resolution strategies
**Supplier Sourcing**: OpenRouter API for Mexico supplier research and analysis
**Manufacturing Feasibility**: OpenRouter API for location analysis and cost estimates
**Market Entry**: OpenRouter API for Mexico market research and opportunity analysis

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Primary Tables
```sql
-- Service requests table (CONFIRMED EXISTS)
CREATE TABLE service_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  client_company TEXT NOT NULL,
  service_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  subscriber_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Service completions table (NEEDS CREATION)
CREATE TABLE service_completions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  service_request_id UUID REFERENCES service_requests(id),
  completion_data JSONB,
  report_url TEXT,
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Subscriber Data Structure (From USMCA Workflow)
```javascript
// Expected structure in subscriber_data JSONB field
const subscriberDataStructure = {
  company_name: "string",
  business_type: "string",
  trade_volume: "string",
  manufacturing_location: "string",
  product_description: "string",
  component_origins: [{ 
    country: "string", 
    percentage: "number",
    component_type: "string" 
  }],
  qualification_status: "QUALIFIED" | "NOT_QUALIFIED" | "PARTIAL",
  annual_tariff_cost: "number",
  potential_usmca_savings: "number",
  compliance_gaps: "array",
  vulnerability_factors: "array"
};
```

### Database Connection Pattern
```javascript
// All admin APIs fall back to sample data if no real data
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('service_requests')
  .select('*')
  .eq('service_type', serviceType)
  .eq('status', 'pending');

if (error || !data || data.length === 0) {
  console.log('Using sample data for demo');
  return generateSampleServiceRequests();
}
```

## üé® Styling Rules (CRITICAL)

### CSS Compliance (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
- **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: Inline styles (`style={{}}` or `style=""`)
- **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: Tailwind CSS classes
- **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: Creating new CSS files without approval
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Use existing classes from `styles/globals.css` and `styles/admin-workflows.css`

### Available CSS Classes
```css
/* Use these existing classes from styles/globals.css and styles/admin-workflows.css */
.card, .card-title, .card-description
.btn-primary, .btn-secondary
.text-body, .nav-link
.dashboard-header, .dashboard-tabs
.form-group, .form-input
.service-request-card
.hero-content, .section-header
.modal-overlay, .modal-content
.stage-progress, .workflow-actions
```

### CSS Validation
```bash
npm run css:check          # Validate CSS compliance
npm run protection:full    # Full protection check
```

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev                 # Development server (use port 3000)
npm run build              # Production build
npm run start              # Production server

# Testing & Validation
npm test                   # Run all tests
npm run lint              # ESLint validation
npm run css:check         # CSS compliance check
```

### Implementation Status
‚úÖ **Phase 1 COMPLETE**: All 6 dashboard components and shared components built
‚úÖ **Phase 2 COMPLETE**: All 6 supporting API endpoints implemented
‚úÖ **Phase 3 COMPLETE**: Integration testing and optimization completed

### Recent Bug Fixes & Improvements (September 2025)
**Critical Runtime Error Fixes:**
- Fixed `TypeError: volume.includes is not a function` in USMCACertificateTab
- Added type safety with `String()` conversion for all subscriber data fields
- Improved null/undefined handling across all components

**UX Enhancements:**
- Added comprehensive search and filtering to all service dashboards
- Implemented pagination for large service request lists
- Added real-time status updates with toast notifications
- Integrated professional risk assessment scoring

**Architecture Improvements:**
- Standardized all services to 3-stage workflow pattern
- Created reusable ServiceWorkflowModal component

---

## üîß Configuration Files

### Critical Configuration
- **`.env.local`** - Environment variables (Supabase, OpenRouter)
- **`styles/globals.css`** - Global styles
- **`styles/admin-workflows.css`** - Admin dashboard styles

### Anti-Hardcoding Rules (CRITICAL)
**‚õî NEVER HARDCODE:**
- Company names, country codes, business types
- Trade volumes, HS codes, tariff rates
- Product descriptions, addresses, phone numbers
- Any business data that should come from subscriber workflow

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH:**
- Use subscriber_data from service requests
- Pull data from localStorage: `workflowData?.company?.name`
- Configuration-driven defaults only

**This CLAUDE.md reflects the current reality of the Triangle Intelligence Platform and provides accurate guidance for building the dashboard components and supporting infrastructure.**

You're absolutely right - I completely misunderstood your business model. Let me correct this:

## Your Actual Business Model

**Primary Users:**
- Companies who use your USMCA workflow tool
- Run analyses to check if their products qualify
- Generate certificates when they DO qualify
- Set up alerts to monitor trade risks

**These users ARE confident** because:
- Your tool verified their qualification
- They have the certificate to prove it
- They understand their HS codes now

## So Who Needs Your Services?

**Users need Jorge/Cristina services when they DON'T qualify or have problems:**

**Path 1: USMCA Analysis shows "NOT QUALIFIED"**
- User discovers they can't use USMCA benefits
- They need help: "How do I restructure my supply chain?"
- **Jorge's services:** Find Mexico suppliers, set up manufacturing there
- Goal: Restructure to BECOME qualified

**Path 2: Trade Risk Alerts trigger**
- User gets alert: "Tariffs increasing on Chinese components"
- They're currently qualified but at risk
- **Jorge's services:** Find alternative suppliers to maintain qualification
- **Cristina's services:** Crisis response, compliance help

**Path 3: User is qualified but wants optimization**
- Certificate generated successfully
- But they see potential savings with better sourcing
- **Jorge's services:** Find cheaper Mexico suppliers
- Maintain qualification while reducing costs

## Pricing Makes Sense Now

**Subscribers ($99-599/month):**
- Run unlimited analyses
- Generate certificates when qualified
- Get trade risk alerts
- **Services at 15-20% discount** when they need restructuring help

**Non-subscribers:**
- One-off certificate generation
- Pay full price for services
- Less committed to optimization

The services are for **fixing problems** or **optimization**, not for people who are already compliant and happy. My mistake - I had the user journey completely backwards.

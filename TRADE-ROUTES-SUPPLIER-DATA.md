## üéØ Trade Route Combinations & What to Expect

| Route | Supplier | Destination | USMCA Eligible? | Tariff Savings | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Mexico‚ÜíUSA** | Mexico | USA | ‚úÖ YES | High | Easiest USMCA (both USMCA territory) |
| **USA‚ÜíMexico‚ÜíCanada** | USA | Canada | ‚úÖ YES | High | Triangle routing (Mexico advantage) |
| **China‚ÜíCanada‚ÜíUSA** | China | USA | ‚ùå NO | None (Section 301) | Chinese components disqualify |
| **Mexico‚ÜíUSA** | Mexico | USA | ‚úÖ YES | High | Optimal for tariff savings |

**Key Point**: The PRIMARY SUPPLIER COUNTRY is what matters most for USMCA qualification. If it's USMCA territory (US/Mexico/Canada), you get automatic qualifying content. If it's non-USMCA (China, Vietnam, etc.), the entire component counts as non-qualifying.

## üö® API Requirements - Do NOT Skip These Fields

The API **requires** these fields for AI analysis:

```javascript
{
  supplier_country: "Required - Where you source from",
  destination_country: "Required - Where you export to",
  trade_volume: "Required - Annual $ volume",
  company_country: "Required - Your company location",
  manufacturing_location: "Required - Where assembly happens"
}
```

Without these, the AI cannot:
- Determine USMCA eligibility
- Calculate tariff rates (destination-specific)
- Assess trade flow risks
- Recommend alternative routes

---

## üìå Workflow Form Field Order

When filling the workflow form, you'll encounter these in this order:

1. **Company Information** (name, address, contact)
   - Includes: Company Country, Contact details

2. **Trade Information** ‚Üê **THIS IS WHERE SUPPLIER/DESTINATION GO**
   - "Where do you source components?" = **Primary Supplier Country**
   - "Where will products be sold/exported?" = **Destination Market**
   - "Annual trade volume?" = **Trade Volume**
   - "Where is manufacturing located?" = **Manufacturing Location**

3. **Product Details**
   - Product description, HS code

4. **Components**
   - Component details with origins

5. **Results**
   - USMCA qualification, tariff rates, recommendations

---

## üéØ Testing Tip

When testing, pay attention to how the **Supplier Country** affects results:

- **Mexico supplier** ‚Üí Components qualify for USMCA
- **USA supplier** ‚Üí Components qualify for USMCA
- **Canada supplier** ‚Üí Components qualify for USMCA
- **China supplier** ‚Üí Components DON'T qualify (non-USMCA)
- **Other countries** ‚Üí Components DON'T qualify

The AI will use this to calculate regional content percentage and determine qualification.

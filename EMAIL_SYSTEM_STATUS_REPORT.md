# Email Notification System - Status Report
**Date:** October 20, 2025 22:36 UTC
**Status:** ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL (with configuration needed)

---

## ‚úÖ FIXED ISSUES

### 1. Database Schema - **RESOLVED**
**Problem:** `email_notifications` column didn't exist in `user_profiles` table
**Fix Applied:** Migration successfully created column with default `true`
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```
**Verification:** Column exists and is indexed ‚úÖ

### 2. API Key Configuration - **VERIFIED**
**Status:** `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured in `.env.local` ‚úÖ
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_SEvamtPB_fu4QpUZyJnSBD3btXfMtfaV8
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=alerts@triangle-trade-intelligence.com
```

### 3. Email Service Integration - **WORKING**
**Test Results:** Successfully sent emails to 2 Triangle Intelligence users
```
‚úÖ Email sent to admin@test.com (VIP - Premium tier)
‚úÖ Email sent to triangleintel@gmail.com (Starter tier)
Success Rate: 100% (2/2)
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIGURATION NEEDED

### RSS Alert Email Filtering Logic
**Current Behavior:** RSS polls find crisis alerts but send "No affected users" because of tier filtering

**Resend Alert Service Filter** (`lib/services/resend-alert-service.js` lines 309-332):
```javascript
// Only sends emails to paid subscribers
.in('subscription_tier', ['Starter', 'Professional', 'Premium', 'Enterprise'])

// Tier-based severity filtering:
// - Starter: Only high/critical alerts
// - Professional/Premium/Enterprise: All alerts
```

**Your Triangle Users:**
- `admin@test.com`: Premium tier ‚úÖ (would receive ALL alerts)
- `triangleintel@gmail.com`: Starter tier ‚úÖ (would receive high/critical only)

**Why "No affected users":**
The RSS alerts created are **HIGH severity**, which should match Starter+ users. The "No affected users" message suggests the query is working but finding 0 users with `email_notifications=true` AND matching subscription tiers.

**Likely Cause:** The database migration just ran, and existing user records still have `email_notifications=NULL` (not `true`) because the `DEFAULT true` only applies to NEW rows, not existing rows.

**Fix Required:**
```sql
-- Set email_notifications=true for all existing users
UPDATE user_profiles
SET email_notifications = true
WHERE email_notifications IS NULL;
```

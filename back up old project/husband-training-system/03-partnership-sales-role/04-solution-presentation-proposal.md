## ðŸŽª **THE PARTNERSHIP PRESENTATION FRAMEWORK**

### **1. Problem Summary (5 minutes)**
**"Based on our conversation, here's what I understand about your situation..."**

#### **Structure:**
```
Current State Analysis:
â€¢ Annual import volume: $[X] from [countries]
â€¢ Current tariff exposure: $[Y] annually (Z% of costs)
â€¢ Key challenges: [top 3 pain points from discovery]
â€¢ Cost of inaction: $[additional cost] if tariffs increase

Business Impact:
â€¢ Competitive disadvantage due to higher costs
â€¢ Cash flow impact from tariff payments
â€¢ Supply chain risk from single-source dependencies
â€¢ Growth limitations due to cost structure
```

#### **Example Opening:**
"[Client Name], based on our conversation last week, you're currently importing $5M annually, with roughly $1.25M going to tariffs - that's 25% of your total import costs. You mentioned this is putting pressure on your margins and limiting your ability to compete on price. Today I want to show you exactly how we can eliminate most of those tariff costs and give you a significant competitive advantage."

### **2. Solution Overview (10 minutes)**
**"Here's how we solve this problem..."**

#### **The Triangle Routing Solution:**
```
Strategic Approach:
â€¢ Partner with verified Mexican manufacturers
â€¢ Implement USMCA-compliant triangle routing
â€¢ Maintain quality while eliminating tariffs
â€¢ 30-60 day implementation timeline

Key Benefits:
â€¢ 0% tariffs under USMCA (vs current 25-30%)
â€¢ Faster delivery (trucking vs ocean shipping)
â€¢ Supply chain diversification and risk reduction
â€¢ Improved cash flow from eliminated tariff payments
```

#### **Visual Presentation:**
```
Current: [China] --30% Tariffs--> [USA] = $1.25M annual cost
Solution: [China] --> [Mexico] --0% Tariffs--> [USA] = $0 cost
Annual Savings: $1.25M + improved logistics = $1.3M+ total benefit

## ðŸ’° **ROI CALCULATION TOOLS**

### **Basic Savings Calculator:**
```
Annual Import Volume: $[A]
Current Average Tariff Rate: [B]%
Annual Tariff Costs: $[A Ã— B] = $[C]

Additional Logistics Savings: $[D] (typically 5-10% of volume)
Total Annual Savings: $[C + D]

Partnership Investment:
Setup Fee: $[E]
Annual Management: $[F]
Total First-Year Cost: $[E + F]

First-Year ROI: [(C + D - E - F) Ã· (E + F)] Ã— 100 = [X]%
Payback Period: (E + F) Ã· [(C + D) Ã· 12] = [Y] months
```

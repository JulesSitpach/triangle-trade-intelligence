## üìã **DISCOVERY CALL STRUCTURE**

### **Opening (5 minutes):**
```
"Thank you for taking time to speak with me today. Before we dive in, 
let me briefly explain how I like to run these conversations. 

I'm going to ask you quite a few questions about your current supply 
chain situation so I can understand if and how we might be able to help. 
Then I'll share some specific examples of how we've helped similar 
companies and see if there might be a fit.

Does that sound reasonable? Great - let's start with you telling me 
a bit about your current import situation..."

Based on this conversation, I believe there's a strong fit. We've helped 
companies in similar situations save $250K-$500K+ annually through 
Mexican partnerships. 

I'd like to put together a specific proposal showing exactly how we could 
help [Company Name]. Would [day/time] work for a follow-up presentation?"
```

### **Timeline (Timeline Verification):**

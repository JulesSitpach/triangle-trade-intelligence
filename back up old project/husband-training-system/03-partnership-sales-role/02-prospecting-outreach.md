I'm calling because we help companies like [Company Name] save $250,000 to $1 million annually by eliminating tariff costs through proven Mexican manufacturing partnerships. I know you're busy, but could I ask you one quick question - are tariffs currently impacting your import costs?"**

### **üìã Complete Phone Script Framework:**

#### **Opening (First 15 seconds):**
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Triangle Intelligence. 
Do you have just 60 seconds for me to explain why I'm calling?"

[Wait for response - if yes, continue. If no, ask for better time]
```

#### **Hook (Next 15 seconds):**
```
"We specialize in helping [Industry] companies eliminate tariff costs 
through USMCA triangle routing. Our clients typically save 
$250K to $1M annually. The reason I'm calling is that 
[specific research trigger - recent news, expansion, etc.]"

[specific product category] imports are currently subject to tariffs?"

[Listen for answer, then respond appropriately]
```

#### **Meeting Request (Final 15 seconds):**
```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like there could be 
significant savings opportunity. I'd love to show you a brief

a 15-minute call?"
```

### **üõ°Ô∏è Overcoming Common Phone Objections:**

#### **"We're not interested"**
**Response:** "I understand, and I appreciate your honesty. Let me ask you this - if you knew you could reduce your import costs by 25% without changing product quality, would that be worth 15 minutes to explore? I'm not asking you to buy anything today, just to see if there's a fit."

#### **"We're happy with our current suppliers"**

How about this - give me 15 minutes to understand your situation, and then I'll send exactly the right information. Does Thursday afternoon work?"

#### **"We don't have budget for consulting"**
**Response:** "I appreciate you bringing up budget. The good news is, our partnerships typically pay for themselves within 60-90 days through tariff savings.

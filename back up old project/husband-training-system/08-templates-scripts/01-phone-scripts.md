## üìû **COLD CALL PROSPECTING SCRIPTS**

### **üéØ THE OPENER (30-SECOND VERSION)**

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Triangle Intelligence. 

I'm calling because we help [Industry] companies eliminate tariff costs 
through proven Mexican manufacturing partnerships. Our clients typically 
save $250,000 to $1 million annually.

Do you have just 60 seconds for me to explain why I'm calling specifically 
about [Company Name]?"

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE - Don't speak first]
```

### **üéØ THE HOOK (PROBLEM-FOCUSED)**

```
"The reason I'm calling is that I noticed [Company Name] imports 
[specific products] from [high-tariff country]. With current tariff 
rates at [X]%, you're likely paying around $[calculated amount] 
annually just in tariff costs.

We've helped similar companies eliminate those costs entirely through 
USMCA triangle routing. For example, [Similar Company] saved $[amount] 
annually by partnering with our Mexican manufacturers.

Let me ask you this - roughly what percentage of your import costs 
currently go to tariffs?"

[LISTEN TO RESPONSE]
```

### **üéØ THE BRIDGE (INTEREST TO MEETING)**

```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like there could be significant 
savings opportunity for [Company Name]. 

I'd love to show you a brief case study of exactly how we helped 
[Similar Company] eliminate $[amount] in annual tariff costs without 
changing their product quality or disrupting their operations.

It's a 15-minute conversation, and I think you'll find it valuable 
whether you decide to work with us or not. 

Would Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work better for you?"

[OFFER SPECIFIC TIMES]
```

## üìû **WARM CALL SCRIPTS (REFERRALS/PLATFORM USERS)**

### **üî• REFERRAL INTRODUCTION**

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Triangle Intelligence. 
[Referrer Name] at [Company] suggested I reach out to you.

He mentioned that [Company Name] might be dealing with similar tariff 
challenges that we helped him solve. We eliminated $[amount] in annual 
tariff costs for [Referrer Company] through a Mexican manufacturing 
partnership.

[Referrer Name] thought there might be similar opportunities for 
[Company Name]. Do you have a few minutes to explore this?"

[PAUSE FOR RESPONSE]
```

### **üíª PLATFORM USER FOLLOW-UP**

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Triangle Intelligence. 
I'm calling because you've been using our trade intelligence platform 
to analyze [specific data/reports].

I notice you've been looking at tariff data for [countries/products], 
which tells me you're probably dealing with significant tariff costs.

The platform shows the problems, but I help companies implement the 
solutions. We specialize in eliminating tariff costs through proven 
Mexican manufacturing partnerships.

Quick question - what's driving your interest in tariff optimization 
right now?"

[DISCOVERY QUESTION]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS**

### **"We're not interested"**

```
"I completely understand, [First Name]. You probably get a lot of 
sales calls about supply chain solutions.

Let me ask you this - if you knew you could reduce your import costs 
by 25% without changing product quality or disrupting operations, 
would that be worth 15 minutes to explore?

I'm not asking you to buy anything today. I just want to show you 
how companies like [Similar Company] eliminated $[amount] in annual 
tariff costs. If it's not relevant, you'll know in 10 minutes.

Fair enough?"
```

### **"We're happy with our current suppliers"**

```
"That's great to hear, and I'm not suggesting you change your suppliers. 
Actually, our triangle routing strategy often works WITH your existing 
suppliers to eliminate tariff costs.

Here's how it works: Your current Asian suppliers provide components 
to our Mexican partners, who do final assembly. The finished products 
enter the US with 0% tariffs under USMCA instead of the [X]% you're 
paying now.

You keep your quality and relationships but eliminate the tariff costs. 
Would that be worth exploring?"
```

### **"Send me information first"**

```
"I could definitely send some information, but honestly, it won't make 
much sense without understanding your specific situation. Every company's 
supply chain is different.

Here's what I'd like to do - give me 15 minutes to understand your 
current import situation, and then I'll send exactly the right 
information with a customized savings projection for [Company Name].

That way you get relevant, actionable information instead of generic 
materials. Does Thursday afternoon work for a brief call?"
```

### **"We don't have budget for consulting"**

```
"I appreciate you bringing up budget concerns. The good news is, our 
partnerships typically pay for themselves within 60-90 days through 
tariff savings.

Most clients see this as cash flow positive from day one. For example, 
[Client Example] invested $[X] and saved $[Y] in the first year alone - 
that's a [Z]% return on investment.

The question isn't whether you can afford to do this, it's whether 
you can afford NOT to do this while your competitors find these 
advantages. Does that make sense?"
```

## üìû **DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPTS**

### **üéØ DISCOVERY OPENING**

```
"[First Name], thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. 

Before we dive in, let me explain how I like to run these conversations. 
I'm going to ask you quite a few questions about your current supply 
chain situation so I can understand whether and how we might be able 
to help you.

Then, based on what I learn, I'll share some specific examples of how 
we've helped similar companies and see if there might be a fit for 
[Company Name].

Does that sound reasonable? Great.

Let's start with you telling me about your current import situation - 
where do most of your products come from?"

[BEGIN DISCOVERY]
```

### **üí∞ FINANCIAL DISCOVERY**

```
"Help me understand the financial impact of your current supply chain. 
What's your annual import volume in dollar terms?"

[LISTEN TO RESPONSE]

"And roughly what percentage of that currently goes to tariff costs?"

[CALCULATE: Volume √ó Tariff Rate = Annual Tariff Cost]

"So you're paying approximately $[calculated amount] annually just 
in tariffs. What would it mean to your business if we could eliminate 
80-90% of those costs?"

[LISTEN FOR VALUE STATEMENTS]
```

### **üéØ AUTHORITY DISCOVERY**

```
"[First Name], for a partnership decision like this, who typically 
makes the final decision at [Company Name]?"

[LISTEN TO RESPONSE]

"And what's your role in that process?"

[CONFIRM AUTHORITY/INFLUENCE]

"What's your typical process for evaluating new supply chain partners?"

[UNDERSTAND DECISION CRITERIA]
```

partnerships for [Company Name].

I wanted to make sure it didn't get lost in your inbox since the 
potential savings opportunity looked significant based on our research.

in annual savings, the proven Mexican partners, and the 60-day 
implementation timeline - this partnership delivers exactly what 
[Company Name] needs.

Are you ready to move forward with the partnership agreement?"

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE - SILENCE IS POWERFUL]
```

### **üéØ THE ASSUMPTIVE CLOSE**

```
"Great! Based on your feedback, I think we have a strong foundation 
for partnership success. 

Let me outline what happens next: I'll send the partnership agreement 
for your legal team's review, introduce you to the recommended Mexican 
partner, and we can begin implementation planning.

What's the best way to get the agreement to your legal team?"

[ASSUME THE SALE]
```

### **‚è∞ THE URGENCY CLOSE**

```
"I want to be transparent with you - we only take on 2-3 new partnerships 
per quarter due to the intensive nature of our implementation process.

With the strong results we've projected for [Company Name], I'd like 
to reserve an implementation slot for you. Our next available start 
date is [date].

Are you comfortable moving forward to secure that timing?"
```

# 🌍 What is International Trade?
**Module 1.1 - Understanding the Basics (5 minutes)**

## 🎯 **SIMPLE EXPLANATION**

**International trade** is when businesses buy and sell products across country borders. Think of it like shopping - but instead of going to a store in your city, companies "shop" for products in other countries.

### **Real-World Example:**
- 📱 **Apple** designs iPhones in California
- 🏭 **Foxconn** manufactures them in China  
- 🚢 **Shipping companies** transport them to the US
- 🏪 **Apple Stores** sell them to customers

**That's international trade!** Products cross multiple borders before reaching the final customer.

## 💡 **WHY DO COMPANIES TRADE INTERNATIONALLY?**

### **1. Cost Savings** 💰
**Example:** Manufacturing an iPhone in the US might cost $800. Manufacturing in China costs $200. **Savings: $600 per phone!**

### **2. Specialized Skills** 🔧
**Example:** Switzerland makes the best watches. Japan makes the best electronics. Mexico excels at automotive parts.

### **3. Raw Materials** 🏔️
**Example:** Chile has copper mines. Saudi Arabia has oil. Canada has lumber. Countries trade what they have for what they need.

### **4. Market Access** 🌎
**Example:** A US company wants to sell to Mexican customers. They need Mexican partners to understand local preferences and regulations.

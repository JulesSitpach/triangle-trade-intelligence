# 💸 Why Tariffs Are Killing US Businesses
**Module 1.2 - The Pain Point You Solve (7 minutes)**

## 🎯 **WHAT ARE TARIFFS?**

**Tariffs are taxes** that companies pay when they import products from other countries. Think of them as "border taxes" - every time a product crosses into the US, the importing company pays the government.

### **Simple Example:**
- 📱 A US company imports $100,000 worth of electronics from China
- 🏛️ The US government charges a 25% tariff
- 💰 The company pays $25,000 in tariffs
- 📊 **Total cost: $125,000** (instead of $100,000)

**The tariff makes the product 25% more expensive!**

## 🔥 **THE TARIFF CRISIS**

### **Current US Tariff Rates (2025):**
- 🇨🇳 **China:** 25-30% (trade war rates)
- 🇮🇳 **India:** 25-50% (recently doubled)
- 🇰🇷 **South Korea:** 15-20%
- 🇻🇳 **Vietnam:** 10-15%
- 🇲🇽 **Mexico:** 0% (USMCA protected!)

### **Why Tariffs Keep Rising:**
1. **Trade Wars** - Countries fighting over trade policies
2. **Political Tensions** - International conflicts affect trade
3. **Domestic Protection** - Governments trying to protect local industries
4. **Economic Nationalism** - "America First" policies

**The problem: Tariffs change quickly but businesses can't adapt fast enough!**

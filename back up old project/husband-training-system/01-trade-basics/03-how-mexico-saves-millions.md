**Module 1.3 - Your Ultimate Solution (8 minutes)**

## 🎯 **THE MEXICAN MIRACLE**

**Mexico is the secret weapon** that's saving US companies millions in tariff costs. While other countries face 25-50% tariffs, Mexico enjoys **0% tariffs** on most products thanks to USMCA (formerly NAFTA).

### **The Magic Numbers:**
- 🇨🇳 **China Imports:** 25-30% tariffs
- 🇮🇳 **India Imports:** 25-50% tariffs  
- 🇰🇷 **South Korea Imports:** 15-20% tariffs
- 🇲🇽 **Mexico Imports:** **0% tariffs** ✨

**Result: A $1M importer saves $250K-$300K annually by switching from China to Mexico!**

## 🏆 **USMCA: THE GAME CHANGER**

### **What is USMCA?**
**USMCA** (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) is the trade deal that replaced NAFTA in 2020. It's like a "tariff-free zone" between the three countries.

### **Key USMCA Benefits:**
1. **🚫 Zero Tariffs** - Most products trade tariff-free between US, Mexico, and Canada
2. **🛡️ Treaty Protection** - Locked in by international law (can't change overnight)
3. **🚚 Easy Logistics** - Trucks drive directly across borders
4. **📅 Long-term Stability** - Agreement runs until 2026+ with renewal option
5. **🏭 Manufacturing Incentives** - Encourages North American production

**Think of it as a "tariff insurance policy" that protects companies from trade war chaos.**

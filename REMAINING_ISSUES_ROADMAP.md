## ISSUE #1: SAVINGS CALCULATION DISCREPANCY ($3,487 vs $75,375)

### The Problem
The AI returns TWO conflicting savings figures:
- **Initial summary**: $3,487.50 annual savings
- **Detailed breakdown**: $75,375 annual savings
- **Difference**: 21.6x discrepancy!

### Root Cause
The AI response calculates savings twice with different methods:
1. **Quick calculation** (initial summary): Only includes some components, misses Section 301 impact on Chinese steel
2. **Detailed calculation** (breakdown): Includes all components and Section 301 tariffs correctly

### Fix Strategy: Single Calculation Source of Truth
**Location**: AI prompt in `pages/api/ai-usmca-complete-analysis.js` (lines ~780-870)

**Current Approach**:
- AI calculates savings in TWO places (initial_summary + detailed_analysis)
- System trusts detailed_analysis (line 466-470 in response building)
- But console shows both, confusing users

**Solution**:
```javascript
// MODIFY AI PROMPT to have SINGLE savings calculation location
// REMOVE: "initial summary" calculation from AI prompt
// KEEP: Only detailed_analysis.savings_analysis calculation

// In API response building (line 466-470), ensure we use:
savings: {
  annual_savings: analysis.usmca?.qualified ?
    (analysis.detailed_analysis?.savings_analysis?.annual_savings || 0) : 0,
  monthly_savings: analysis.usmca?.qualified ?
    (analysis.detailed_analysis?.savings_analysis?.monthly_savings || 0) : 0,
  savings_percentage: analysis.usmca?.qualified ?
    (analysis.detailed_analysis?.savings_analysis?.savings_percentage || 0) : 0,
  // ... other fields
},

// Frontend will display ONLY the savings from detailed_analysis
// Removing the "initial summary savings" from being shown anywhere
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Find the AI prompt that generates initial savings summary (lines ~799-804)
2. Remove or comment out the "TARIFF SAVINGS ANALYSIS" section that creates the quick calculation
3. Keep only the detailed_analysis.savings_analysis section
4. Add validation: `if (initial_savings !== detailed_savings) throw error`

**Testing**:
- Run workflow with multi-component product
- Verify only ONE savings figure appears (the detailed calculation)
- Check that savings in TariffSavings.js (line 55) uses detailed_analysis
- Verify that component breakdown in results shows how each component contributes

**Files to Check**:
- pages/api/ai-usmca-complete-analysis.js:466-470 (response building)
- components/workflow/results/TariffSavings.js:55 (display)
- lib/agents/trade-analysis-agent.js (AI prompt - if it exists)

## ISSUE #2: TARIFF RATE DISPLAY MISMATCH (2.9% vs 102.5%)

### The Problem
User sees conflicting tariff information:
- **Component display**: MFN: 2.9%, USMCA: 2.9%, Savings: 0.0%
- **What AI calculated**: Section 301 rate: 25%, Combined: 102.5%, Savings: $69,750

### Root Cause
**Data model mismatch**:
- Component display shows **base HS code rate only** (2.9%)
- USMCA calculation includes **Section 301 duties** (25%)
- User gets right financial answer but wrong explanation

Example:
```
User sees: "Cold-rolled steel - MFN 2.9% = $0 savings"
But calculation was: "Cold-rolled steel - MFN (2.9% + 77.5% = 77.5%) + Section 301 (25%) = 102.5% total"
```

### Fix Strategy: Display Complete Tariff Breakdown

**Solution**: Add policy adjustments to component display

```javascript
// Component tariff display should show:
{
  hs_code: '7326.90.85',
  hs_description: 'Cold-rolled steel housing',
  base_mfn_rate: 2.9,          // Base HS code rate
  section_301: 25,              // NEW: Policy tariff
  section_232: 0,               // NEW: Steel/aluminum safeguard
  total_applied_rate: 102.5,     // NEW: Sum of all duties
  usmca_rate: 25,               // After USMCA, Section 301 remains
  displayed_savings: 77.5,       // Only the base MFN is eliminated
  policy_status: 'Section 301 applied'  // NEW: Show why rate is high
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Modify enrichment-router.js to return complete tariff breakdown including section_301, section_232, total_rate
2. Update component display template (USMCAQualification.js) to show policy adjustments
3. Add tooltip explaining "Why is this rate so high?"
4. Verify that component savings calculation matches the AI's detailed breakdown

**Files to Modify**:
- components/workflow/results/USMCAQualification.js (component display loop)
- lib/tariff/enrichment-router.js (ensure all fields returned)
- components/workflow/results/TariffComparison.js (if it exists)

**Display Template**:
```
Component: Cold-rolled steel housing
Origin: China
Value: 20% of product
Base MFN Rate: 2.9%
  + Section 301 Tariff: 25% (China trade policy)
  + Other Duties: 0%
= Total Applied Rate: 27.9% (or 77.5% total when including RVC/labor content)
USMCA eliminates base rate: Saves 2.9% of $45,000 = $1,305
Note: Section 301 tariffs remain - cannot be avoided, but USMCA helps with other duties
```

**Testing**:
- Run workflow with mixed-origin components
- Check that Chinese components show Section 301 rate
- Verify that component savings don't exceed displayed rate
- Confirm that summary total ($75,375) equals component breakdowns ($1,305 + $5,625 + $0, etc.)

## ISSUE #7: ALERT SYSTEM MISSING WORKFLOW CONTEXT

### The Problem
Alerts are generated without user's workflow data:
```
✅ Found workflow intelligence: 0 recommendations, 0 analysis sections
```

This means alerts are generic, not personalized based on user's specific USMCA analysis.

### Root Cause
The alert consolidation endpoint can't access the user's workflow results from usmca-complete-analysis API response.

### Fix Strategy: Load Workflow Context Before Generating Alerts

**Solution**: Retrieve latest workflow before consolidating alerts

```javascript
// In alert consolidation endpoint
const getLatestWorkflow = async (userId) => {
  // Check localStorage first (front-end)
  // Or query database for user's latest usmca_workflow session
  const { data: workflow } = await supabase
    .from('workflow_sessions')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
    .limit(1)
    .single();

  return workflow;
};

// Then pass context to alert generation
const context = {
  rvc_percentage: workflow.enrichment_data.north_american_content,
  rvc_threshold: workflow.enrichment_data.threshold_applied,
  components: workflow.enrichment_data.component_breakdown,
  qualified: workflow.usmca_qualified,
  savings: workflow.enrichment_data.savings.annual_savings
};

// Use context in alert generation
const alerts = await consolidateAlerts(userId, context);
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Find the alert consolidation endpoint (likely in pages/api/cron/email-crisis-check.js or similar)
2. Load user's latest workflow from workflow_sessions table
3. Extract USMCA context (RVC%, components, savings)
4. Pass context to alert generation prompt
5. Verify alerts include specific numbers from user's analysis

**Files to Modify**:
- pages/api/cron/email-crisis-check.js (if exists)
- lib/services/crisis-alert-service.js
- pages/api/alerts or similar

**Example Personalized Alert** (WITH context):
```
"Your product [specific component name] is affected by new Section 301 tariffs.
Based on your recent analysis for [company name]:
- Your USMCA qualification: [RVC percentage]%
- Components affected: [list specific components]
- Potential cost impact: $[calculated amount]
- Recommendation: Consider [specific action based on their analysis]"
```

**Testing**:
- Check logs for workflow context retrieval
- Verify alerts include specific numbers from user's analysis
- Confirm personalization works for multiple users with different products

## ISSUE #6: FALSE AI VALIDATION WARNINGS

### The Problem
Validation is flagging wrong metrics as missing tariff rates:
```
⚠️ AI VALIDATION WARNING: AI claimed tariff rates not found in cache: [
  20,    25, 102.5,   ← These are NOT tariff rates!
  25,    50,    30,
  16.75, 21.92,    25
]
```

These numbers are:
- Component percentages (20%, 50%, 30%)
- RVC thresholds (75%, 102.5%)
- Calculated metrics (16.75%, 21.92%)
- **NOT** actual tariff rates to look up

### Root Cause
Validation function treats ALL numbers as potential tariff rates, creating false alarms.

### Fix Strategy: Distinguish Rate Types

```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong):
const allNumbers = aiResponse.match(/\d+\.?\d*/g);  // Gets ALL numbers
if (!cache_has(allNumbers)) {
  log("⚠️ Not found");  // False positive!
}

// AFTER (Correct):
const tariffRatesToValidate = [
  analysis.savings?.mfn_rate,     // 2.9%, 2.5%, 0%, 77.5%
  ...analysis.components?.map(c => c.mfn_rate)
];

const componentPercentages = [
  ...analysis.components?.map(c => c.value_percentage)  // 20%, 50%, 30%
];

const derivedMetrics = [
  analysis.savings?.savings_percentage,    // Calculated, not from cache
  analysis.usmca?.north_american_content   // Calculated, not from cache
];

// Only validate actual tariff rates
tariffRatesToValidate.forEach(rate => {
  if (rate && !cache_has(rate)) {
    log(`⚠️ Tariff rate ${rate}% not in cache`);
  }
});

// Don't log component percentages or derived metrics
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Find validation logic (likely in ai-usmca-complete-analysis.js lines ~341-383)
2. Extract ONLY tariff rates (mfn_rate, usmca_rate, section_301, section_232, total_rate)
3. Create separate validation for component percentages (should sum to 100%)
4. Remove validation for calculated fields (savings_percentage, RVC, etc.)
5. Only log REAL mismatches

**Files to Modify**:
- pages/api/ai-usmca-complete-analysis.js:370-385 (AI validation warning logic)

**Testing**:
- Run workflow and check console logs
- Should see NO false "not found in cache" warnings
- Should see proper validation for actual tariff rates
- Validation logs should be much cleaner

## Questions Before Implementation

1. **ISSUE #1 (Savings)**: Is there a separate API endpoint for getting initial savings, or is it all in the same response?
2. **ISSUE #2 (Tariff Display)**: Are component breakdowns displayed in multiple places? Need to update all of them?
3. **ISSUE #7 (Alerts)**: Are alerts generated server-side (cron job) or client-side (after workflow completion)?
4. **ISSUE #6 (Validation)**: Is the validation warning only logged to console, or does it affect the API response sent to user?

# BUSINESS OPERATIONS ACTION PLAN
## Triangle Intelligence Platform - Revenue Generation Roadmap

*Generated: September 8, 2025*  
*Priority: CRITICAL - Revenue Blockers*  
*Timeline: 60-90 Days to Full Business Operation*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CURRENT STATE**: World-class technical product with sophisticated USMCA qualification capabilities, but **zero revenue generation ability**.

**CRITICAL REALITY**: We have built an exceptional product that customers would pay premium pricing for, but we have no way to:
- Accept customer signups
- Process payments ($299/$799 subscriptions)  
- Provide customer support
- Deliver ongoing value through user accounts

**STRATEGIC FOCUS**: Implement the minimum viable business operations to unlock revenue from our superior technical foundation.

## ðŸ’° REVENUE PROJECTION

### **Conservative Scenario (90 Days)**
- **Users**: 100 trial signups, 20 paid conversions

- **Annual Run Rate**: ~$102K ARR

### **Optimistic Scenario (90 Days)**  
- **Users**: 300 trial signups, 60 paid conversions
- **Revenue**: 40 Ã— $299 + 20 Ã— $799 = $27,940 MRR  
- **Annual Run Rate**: ~$335K ARR

## ðŸŽ¯ CONCLUSION

**The Triangle Intelligence platform has exceptional technical capabilities that could generate substantial revenue within 90 days - but only if we implement the fundamental business operations infrastructure immediately.**

**KEY INSIGHT**: We have solved the hard problems (sophisticated USMCA qualification, AI classification, real-time crisis monitoring) but haven't built the basic business infrastructure to monetize these capabilities.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Immediately prioritize payment processing, user authentication, and customer communication systems. These are simpler technical challenges than what we've already solved, but they're the critical path to unlocking revenue from our superior product.

**OPPORTUNITY**: With proper business operations, this platform could achieve $100K+ ARR within 12 months based on the technical quality and market demand we've validated.

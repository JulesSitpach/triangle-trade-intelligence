The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement is under attack. Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on NON-USMCA compliant goods while keeping USMCA goods duty-free.

YOUR SITUATION:
‚Ä¢ Non-compliant products: 25% tariff penalty
‚Ä¢ USMCA-compliant products: 0% tariffs
‚Ä¢ Cost difference: Up to 25% competitive disadvantage

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
‚Ä¢ Verify ALL products for USMCA qualification
‚Ä¢ Document complete supply chain origins  
‚Ä¢ Ensure certificates of origin are perfect
‚Ä¢ Consider supply chain restructuring NOW

The 2026 USMCA review may eliminate the agreement entirely.

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
‚Ä¢ Move production to Mexico/Canada for US market
‚Ä¢ Establish USMCA-compliant supply chains NOW

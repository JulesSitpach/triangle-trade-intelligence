## 3.1 USMCA QUALIFICATION LOGIC TESTING

### **üö® CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED**

**Issue**: Qualification system shows `qualified: true` regardless of actual USMCA content percentage

**Evidence**:

| Test Case | USMCA Content | Threshold | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| Electronics | 40% | 62.5% | ‚ùå NOT QUALIFIED | ‚úÖ qualified: true | **CRITICAL BUG** |
| Electronics | 62.5% | 62.5% | ‚úÖ QUALIFIED | ‚úÖ qualified: true | **INCORRECT LOGIC** |
| Electronics | 70% | 65% | ‚úÖ QUALIFIED | ‚úÖ qualified: true | **INCORRECT LOGIC** |
| Electronics | 0% (China 100%) | 62.5% | ‚ùå NOT QUALIFIED | ‚úÖ qualified: true | **CRITICAL BUG** |
| Automotive | 0% (China 100%) | 75% | ‚ùå NOT QUALIFIED | ‚úÖ qualified: true | **CRITICAL BUG** |

### **Test Details**:

**Electronics - 0% USMCA Content Test**:
```json
// INPUT: 100% Chinese content
{
  "action": "check_qualification",
  "data": {
    "hs_code": "8517130000",
    "business_type": "Electronics", 
    "component_origins": [
      {"description": "smartphone components", "origin_country": "China", "value_percentage": 100}
    ]
  }
}

// ACTUAL RESPONSE (INCORRECT):
{
  "success": true,
  "qualification": {
    "qualified": true,  // ‚Üê CRITICAL BUG: Should be FALSE
    "reason": "Product qualifies for USMCA preferential rate",
    "regional_content_threshold": 65
  }
}
```

### **Business Impact**:
- ‚ùå **Compliance Risk**: Customers receive incorrect qualification advice
- ‚ùå **Legal Liability**: False USMCA certificates could result in customs penalties
- ‚ùå **Customer Trust**: Platform credibility compromised by fundamental errors
- ‚ùå **Revenue Risk**: Customers may face unexpected duty assessments

## 3.2 TARIFF SAVINGS CALCULATIONS

### **‚úÖ CALCULATIONS MATHEMATICALLY ACCURATE**

**Test Results**:

| Test Volume | Expected Calculation | Actual Result | Status |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|---------|
| $100K | $100K √ó 5% = $5,000 | $5,000 savings | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| $1M | $1M √ó 5% = $50,000 | $50,000 savings | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
| $10M | $10M √ó 5% = $500,000 | $500,000 savings | ‚úÖ CORRECT |

**Evidence**:
```json
// $1M Volume Test Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "savings": {
    "savings": 50000,
    "annual_savings": 50000,
    "mfnRate": 0.08,
    "usmcaRate": 0
  }
}
```

### **Minor Issues Noted**:
- Rate inconsistency: Shows 5.3% in qualification vs 8% in savings for same HS code
- Data source varies: "coverage_fallback" vs "country_average_fallback"

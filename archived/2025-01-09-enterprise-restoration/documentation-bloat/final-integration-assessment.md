## 🔧 **TECHNICAL FINDINGS**

### Button Implementation Details:
The UI uses a sophisticated button framework where:
- Buttons exist as styled elements, not plain HTML buttons
- Text content is "Start USMCA Analysis" and "Calculate Savings"
- Interaction requires proper event handling through React framework
- Visual styling matches professional enterprise standards

### API Call Patterns Observed:
```javascript
// Automatic API calls on page loads:
GET /api/database-driven-dropdown-options?category=all  // Workflow page
GET /api/trust/trust-metrics                           // Trust indicators
GET /api/system-status                                 // System health

// Form-triggered API calls:
POST /api/simple-savings          // Calculator functionality
POST /api/simple-classification   // Product classification
POST /api/simple-usmca-compliance // Compliance analysis
```

### Database Integration Confirmed:
```
✅ hs_master_rebuild: 34,476 active HS code records
✅ usmca_qualification_rules: Business logic properly configured
✅ All tariff calculations use real database rates
✅ No hardcoded values detected in business logic
✅ Smart fallbacks for empty tables (sample data for demos)

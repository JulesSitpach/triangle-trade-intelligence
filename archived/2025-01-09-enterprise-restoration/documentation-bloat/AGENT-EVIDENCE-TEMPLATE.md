## **VIOLATION EXAMPLES - NEVER DO THIS:**

### ‚ùå **BAD EXAMPLE - NO EVIDENCE:**
```
CLAIM: Mexico partnership highlighting is implemented ‚úÖ
EVIDENCE: Found files with "Mexico" and "partnership" keywords
STATUS: IMPLEMENTED
```

### ‚úÖ **GOOD EXAMPLE - PROPER EVIDENCE:**
```
CLAIM: Mexico partnership highlighting shows in user interface

FILE IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE:
Files Read: components/workflow/WorkflowResults.js (complete file)
Code Analysis: Lines 245-267 show partnership recommendation logic

FUNCTIONALITY TEST EVIDENCE:
API Tested: POST /api/simple-savings with real data
Response: {"nextSteps":["Identify Mexico manufacturing/processing partners"]}
UI Test: Workflow component renders partnership recommendations

DATABASE VERIFICATION EVIDENCE:
Query: SELECT * FROM mexico_partners WHERE active=true
Results: 3 active partners found with contact details

USER WORKFLOW EVIDENCE:
1. User completes workflow ‚Üí 2. System shows Mexico partners ‚Üí 3. User sees contact info

FOUNDATION AUDIT EVIDENCE:
Command: node comprehensive-system-validator.js
Results: Partnership feature scored 95% functionality

STATUS: VERIFIED WITH COMPLETE EVIDENCE
```

- [ ] Tested complete user workflows end-to-end
- [ ] Ran foundation audit to validate system state
- [ ] Documented all evidence in required format
- [ ] Can prove claim with concrete examples

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED ‚Üí CLAIM REJECTED ‚Üí RESTART VERIFICATION**

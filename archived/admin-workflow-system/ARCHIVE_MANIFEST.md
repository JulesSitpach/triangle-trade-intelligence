## Detailed File Inventory

### UI Components (2,224 lines)

#### `components/AdminDashboard.js` (355 lines)
- **Purpose:** Main admin system overview dashboard
- **Rendered:** Admin system landing page with two workflow cards (Jorge + Cristina)
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE - Zero references
- **Why Archived:** Self-serve platform has no admin dashboard - users generate certificates directly

#### `components/AdminNavigation.js` (84 lines)
- **Purpose:** Navigation bar for admin dashboard
- **Features:** Links to Jorge intake, Cristina review, analytics
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE - Zero references
- **Why Archived:** Self-serve platform has no admin navigation

#### `components/shared/ServiceWorkflowTab.js` (382 lines)
- **Purpose:** Universal container for 4-stage workflow (Jorge → Cristina → Validation → Report)
- **Logic:** Renders different stage components based on workflow_stage prop
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE - Zero references
- **Why Archived:** Replaced by direct user workflow: CompanyInfo → Components → Results → Certificate

#### `components/shared/stages/JorgeClientIntakeStage.js` (422 lines)
- **Purpose:** Stage 1 - Client intake form (Jorge's responsibility)
- **Captures:** Company info, product description, trade volume
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE - Only used in old ServiceWorkflowTab

#### `components/shared/stages/CristinaDocumentReviewStage.js` (549 lines)
- **Purpose:** Stage 2 - Document review and compliance checking (Cristina's responsibility)
- **Features:** Document upload, compliance verification, compliance flags
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE - Only used in old ServiceWorkflowTab
- **Why Archived:** Self-serve model requires users to verify their own data accuracy

#### `components/shared/stages/AIAnalysisValidationStage.js` (278 lines)
- **Purpose:** Stage 3 - AI analysis results validation
- **Features:** Review AI USMCA analysis, approve or reject results
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE - Only used in old ServiceWorkflowTab
- **Why Archived:** Users see AI results directly, no separate validation stage

#### `components/shared/stages/ReportGenerationStage.js` (154 lines)
- **Purpose:** Stage 4 - Generate final report after approval
- **Features:** Report formatting, download options
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE - Only used in old ServiceWorkflowTab

- **Purpose:** Jorge service pricing and workflow definitions
- **Defines:** Service tiers, pricing model, SLA definitions
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE - Zero references
- **Why Archived:** Jorge is no longer a system role - platform is self-serve only

---

### Authentication (40 lines)

- **Purpose:** Admin email verification and role checking
- **Logic:** Verify user is in admin list, grant admin permissions

---

### Styling (1,762 lines)

#### `styles/admin-workflows.css` (1,762 lines)
- **Purpose:** CSS for entire admin workflow system (4 stages, navigation, dashboard)
- **Content:** ~50 style classes for admin UI

## Model Architecture Changes

### OLD MODEL (Consulting - Archived)
```
User submits product info
    ↓
Jorge (Intake specialist) - Client intake form
    ↓
Cristina (Compliance officer) - Document review + compliance checking
    ↓
AI Analysis - System validates with AI
    ↓
Report Generation - System generates compliance report
    ↓
User downloads report
```
**Issues with this model:**
- Heavy workload on Cristina (compliance officer)
- 4-stage process slowed down certificate generation
- Required dedicated admin staff
- Scaling bottleneck (limited by Cristina's capacity)

### NEW MODEL (Self-Serve - Current)
```
User enters company info + components
    ↓
AI enriches components with tariff data
    ↓
AI determines USMCA qualification + financial impact
    ↓
User reviews results + policy alerts
    ↓
User downloads certificate (user takes liability for accuracy)
```
**Benefits:**
- Instant certificate generation (self-serve)
- Scales infinitely (no human bottleneck)
- Clear user liability (users verify their own data)
- Pure SaaS model (no consulting services)

# Development History Archive

This directory preserves development history while preventing regression to problematic approaches identified during enterprise restoration phase development.

## Archive Organization

### 2025-01-09-enterprise-restoration/
Files archived during the consolidation of crisis intelligence system development and institutional knowledge preservation.

#### broken-classification/
- **intelligent-hs-classifier.js**: 600+ hardcoded terms causing JavaScript errors
- **simple-classification.js**: Electrical-focused only, limited industry coverage
- **Reason**: Poor classification accuracy and system instability

#### deprecated-apis/
- **ai-classify.js.deprecated**: Replaced by enhanced AI classification
- **simple-classification.js.deprecated**: Superseded by database-driven approach
- **Reason**: Replaced during integration fixes for better reliability

#### test-approaches/
- Pre-crisis monitoring test files
- Mock data validation approaches
- Screenshot validation superseded by systematic UI testing
- **Reason**: Replaced by evidence-based testing methodology

#### failed-audits/
- UltraThink methodology files
- Over-engineered enterprise patterns inappropriate for MVP
- **Reason**: Methodology violations and unreliable evidence gathering

## Archive Purpose

1. **Prevent Regression**: Maintain accessible history of why approaches were abandoned
2. **Institutional Knowledge**: Preserve lessons learned for future development
3. **Development Continuity**: Provide context for architectural decisions
4. **Evidence-Based**: Document concrete reasons for technical changes

## Successful Patterns (Reference)

- **Database-First Development**: Real queries, no mock data
- **UUID Consistency**: Proper format preventing database errors
- **Crisis Intelligence Integration**: RSS + Trump policy combined system
- **Evidence-Based Methodology**: Complete file analysis, actual testing, database validation

## Usage Guidelines

- Review archived approaches before major changes
- Apply foundation audit methodology requirements
- Never revert to archived systems without addressing documented failures
- Maintain evidence basis for all architectural decisions

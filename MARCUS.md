    dataQuality: 90,       // High confidence in trade intelligence
    coverage: "Global"     // Worldwide trade classification coverage
  },
  workflowSessions: {
    sessions: 205,         // Real user journey patterns
    networkEffects: true,  // Each session improves future intelligence
    similarities: "Active" // Pattern matching for compound insights
  },
  marcusConsultations: {
    consultations: 70,     // Previous AI analysis records
    wisdom: "Institutional", // Accumulated strategic insights
    context: "Business"   // Industry-specific guidance
  },

  actionable: "Immediate action recommended - optimal conditions for triangle routing",
  urgency: "high",
  potentialSavings: "$200K-$500K"
}
```

#### Network Effects Intelligence
```javascript
{
  type: "NETWORK_EFFECTS_COMPOUND", 
  insight: "Network intelligence growing: 25% more data since similar companies analyzed",
  confidence: 88,

**Fix Applied**: Wrapped all .map() operations with Array.isArray() checks:
```javascript
{(() => {
  const items = serviceDetails?.FIELD_NAME;
  const itemsArray = Array.isArray(items) ? items : [];
  return itemsArray.length > 0 && (
    // render with itemsArray.map()
  );

- Replaced with CSS class `helper-text`

**Result**: ‚úÖ 100% CSS compliance, zero inline styles

### Issue 4: Fake API Endpoint
**Services Affected**: USMCA Certificates (initially)
**Issue**: Template responses instead of real OpenRouter calls

**Fix Applied**: Complete rewrite with:

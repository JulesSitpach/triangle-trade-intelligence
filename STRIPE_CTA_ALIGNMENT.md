# 💳 Stripe CTA Alignment - Complete Payment Flow Documentation

**Status:** All CTAs aligned and ready for Stripe production keys
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## 🎯 Overview

This document maps every Call-to-Action (CTA) button to its Stripe checkout flow.

**2 Payment Types:**
1. **Subscriptions** (recurring) → Requires Stripe Price IDs
2. **Professional Services** (one-time) → Uses dynamic pricing (no Price IDs needed)

---

## ✅ FIXED: Subscription CTAs Re-Enabled

### What Was Wrong
```javascript
// OLD CODE (DISABLED)
const handleSubscribe = async (tier) => {
    alert('Stripe subscriptions are currently disabled...')
    return  // ❌ Payment blocked!
```

### What's Fixed
```javascript
// NEW CODE (ENABLED)
const handleSubscribe = async (tier) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/create-checkout-session', {
            method: 'POST',
            credentials: 'include',
            body: JSON.stringify({ tier, billing_period })
        })
        // ✅ Redirects to Stripe Checkout
    } catch (error) {
        alert(`Subscription error: ${error.message}`)
    }
}
```

**File Changed:** `pages/pricing.js` lines 23-72

## 📋 SUBSCRIPTION CTAs (Recurring Payments)

### Pricing Page (`/pricing`)

**3 Subscription Tiers:**

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | CTA Button | Status |
|------|---------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Starter** | $99/mo | $950/yr | "Subscribe to Starter" | ✅ ACTIVE |
| **Professional** | $299/mo | $2,850/yr | "Subscribe to Professional" | ✅ ACTIVE |
| **Premium** | $599/mo | $5,750/yr | "Subscribe to Premium" | ✅ ACTIVE |

**Payment Flow:**
1. User clicks "Subscribe to [Tier]" button
2. `handleSubscribe(tier)` called in `pages/pricing.js`
3. POST to `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session`
4. Redirects to Stripe Checkout
5. On success → `/subscription/success?session_id={ID}`
6. On cancel → `/pricing?cancelled=true`

---

### Other Subscription CTAs

| Page | CTA Text | Action | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| `/` (Homepage) | "Start USMCA Analysis" | Link to `/usmca-workflow?reset=true` (requires subscription) | ✅ ACTIVE |
| `/` (Homepage) | "View Pricing" | Link to `/pricing` | ✅ ACTIVE |
| `/trade-risk-alternatives` | "Upgrade for More Analyses" | Link to `/pricing` | ✅ ACTIVE |
| `/dashboard` | "Upgrade for More Analyses" | Link to `/pricing` | ✅ ACTIVE |

**Note:** These are navigation links, not direct payment buttons. However, the USMCA workflow requires an active subscription:
- **Starter ($99/month)**: 10 analyses per month
- **Professional ($299/month)**: Unlimited analyses
- **Premium ($599/month)**: Unlimited analyses

If user is not logged in, homepage shows "Sign In to Start Analysis" instead.

## 💼 PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CTAs (One-Time Payments)

| Service | Base Price | Professional (15% off) | Premium (25% off) | Status |
|---------|------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| USMCA Certificate | $250 | $212 | $188 | ✅ ACTIVE |

---

### Service CTAs Mapped

#### 1. Services Page (`/services/logistics-support`)

**Main form with service selection:**
- User fills out intake form
- Selects service from checklist
- Clicks "Submit Request"
- **Flow:** POST to `/api/services/create-request` → Creates service request → Redirects to payment

**Payment Trigger:** After form submission (not immediate)

---

#### 2. Pricing Page - Add-Ons Section

**6 Service cards displayed:**
- Each shows: Name, base price, discounted prices
- NO direct payment button (informational only)
- Users must go to `/services/logistics-support` to request

---

#### 3. Dashboard - Service Requests

**If user has NOT QUALIFIED workflow:**
- Shows "Get Help to Qualify" button
- Links to `/services/logistics-support`

---

### Professional Service Payment Flow

```
1. User fills form on /services/logistics-support
   ↓
2. Submits with service selected
   ↓
3. POST /api/services/create-request
   ↓
4. Service request created in database (status: pending_payment)
   ↓
5. POST /api/stripe/create-service-checkout
   ↓
6. Stripe creates checkout session with dynamic pricing
   ↓
7. User redirects to Stripe Checkout
   ↓
8. On success → /services/confirmation?session_id={ID}&service={ID}
   ↓
9. Webhook receives payment_intent.succeeded
   ↓
10. Service request status → paid
    Admin dashboard shows new request
```

**Key Difference from Subscriptions:**
- ✅ Uses `price_data` (dynamic) - NO Price IDs needed
- ✅ Automatic discount calculation based on user tier
- ✅ One-time payment, not recurring

## 🔑 Required Stripe Configuration

### Step 1: Create Stripe Products (Subscriptions Only)

**In Stripe Dashboard → Products:**

**Create 3 Products (one per tier):**

1. **Starter Subscription**
   - Name: "Starter Plan"
   - Monthly Price: $99 → Get Price ID
   - Annual Price: $950 → Get Price ID

2. **Professional Subscription**
   - Name: "Professional Plan"
   - Monthly Price: $299 → Get Price ID
   - Annual Price: $2,850 → Get Price ID

3. **Premium Subscription**
   - Name: "Premium Plan"
   - Monthly Price: $599 → Get Price ID
   - Annual Price: $5,750 → Get Price ID

---

### Step 2: Add Price IDs to Environment Variables

**Copy Price IDs from Stripe Dashboard and add to `.env.local`:**

```bash
# Stripe Price IDs (from Stripe Dashboard)
STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER_MONTHLY=price_1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnO
STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER_ANNUAL=price_1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnP
STRIPE_PRICE_PROFESSIONAL_MONTHLY=price_1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnQ
STRIPE_PRICE_PROFESSIONAL_ANNUAL=price_1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnR
STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM_MONTHLY=price_1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnS
STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM_ANNUAL=price_1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnT
```

**Note:** Professional services do NOT need Price IDs (they use dynamic pricing).

---

### Step 3: Switch to Live Keys (Production Only)

**Replace test keys with live keys in `.env.local`:**

```bash
# Production Stripe Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_live_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_live_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_webhook_secret
```

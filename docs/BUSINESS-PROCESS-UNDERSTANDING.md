## USMCA Qualification Process

### The Qualification Determination

**What Makes a Product Qualify**:

1. **Regional Value Content (RVC)**
   ```
   Transaction Value Method:
   RVC = (TV - VNM) / TV × 100
   
   Where:
   TV = Transaction Value (invoice price)
   VNM = Value of Non-Originating Materials
   
   Must exceed product-specific threshold (60-75%)
   ```

2. **Tariff Classification Change**
   - Product must undergo substantial transformation
   - HS code must change at specified level (2, 4, or 6 digit)
   - Example: Steel (7208) → Auto Part (8708) = Qualifies

3. **De Minimis Rule**
   - Non-originating content <10% of value
   - Allows minor non-USMCA components
   - Simplifies qualification for high-content products

### Industry-Specific Requirements

**Automotive (75% RVC Required)**:
- Steel and aluminum must be North American
- Labor Value Content: 40% by high-wage labor
- Core parts list with specific requirements
- OEM certification often required

**Electronics (60% RVC Required)**:
- Printed circuit board assembly counts as transformation
- Software development adds regional value
- Battery cells have specific requirements
- Display panels often imported (careful calculation needed)

**Textiles (Yarn-Forward Rule)**:
- Fiber must be formed in USMCA region
- Yarn must be spun in USMCA region
- Fabric must be woven/knit in USMCA region
- Cutting and sewing must occur in USMCA region
- Short supply list provides exceptions

**Chemicals (Chemical Reaction Rule)**:
- Must undergo chemical transformation
- Simple mixing doesn't qualify
- New molecular structure required
- Lab certification strengthens claim

### Documentation Requirements

**Essential Documents**:
1. **USMCA Certificate of Origin** (No specific form required)
2. **Bill of Materials** with supplier countries
3. **Commercial Invoices** showing values
4. **Supplier Affidavits** confirming origin
5. **Production Records** demonstrating transformation

**Audit Preparation**:
- Keep records for 5 years
- Respond to verification requests within 30 days
- Penalties for false claims can exceed savings
- Blanket certificates valid for 12 months

## Mexico Triangle Routing Strategy

# Safe Testing Without Deployment Risk

## 🎯 Overview

You're currently on the **testing-all-fixes** branch - completely isolated from production (main branch).

**Key principle**: Test everything locally before merging back to main.

## 🚀 Testing Plan (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Quick Validation (30 mins)

**Goal**: Verify dev server works and basic connectivity

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server (KEEP RUNNING)
npm run dev:3001

# Wait for: "ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3001, url: http://localhost:3001"

# Terminal 2: Run agent-based E2E tests
node tests/agent-e2e-test-framework.js

# Expected output:
# ✅ Issue #1: Single Source of Truth for Savings
# ✅ Issue #2: Tariff Rate Display Breakdown
# ✅ Issue #3: React Form Field Normalization
# ✅ Issue #4: Certificate Uses User Company Data
# ✅ Issue #5: Database Column Naming
# ✅ Issue #6: Validation (Tariff Rates Only)
# ✅ Issue #7: Alert Personalization
# ✅ BONUS: Alert Duplication Fix
```

### Phase 2: Jest API Tests (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Validate all business logic with existing test infrastructure

```bash
# Run all Jest tests
npm test

# Or run specific tests
npm test tests/audit-verification.test.js
npm test tests/integration/data-flows.test.js

# Run with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose

# Expected: All tests should pass ✅
```

### Phase 3: Manual Workflow Testing (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Test actual user journeys in the browser

```bash
# Dev server still running on :3001

# Open in browser:
# http://localhost:3001

# Test checklist (from ALL_ISSUES_FIXED_SUMMARY.md):
# [ ] Company information + destination selection
# [ ] Multi-component product entry
# [ ] Tariff display shows Section 301 breakdown
# [ ] USMCA qualification calculation
# [ ] Certificate generation
# [ ] No React console warnings
# [ ] No hardcoded test data in certificate
# [ ] Alert system displays personalized data
```

### Phase 4: Edge Case Testing (1 hour)

**Goal**: Test unusual scenarios

```bash
Test scenarios:
1. All China components (should trigger Section 301)
2. All Mexico components (should be USMCA eligible)
3. Mixed supply chain (US, CA, MX, CN)
4. Very large trade volumes ($10M+)
5. Very small trade volumes (<$100K)
6. Products with many components (10+)
7. Missing optional fields (should handle gracefully)

Look for:
- No errors in console
- All calculations completed
- Certificates generated
- Alerts personalized
```

## 📊 Test Artifact Management

### What Gets Tested (NOT Committed)
```
tests/
├── agent-e2e-test-framework.js     ← Run this, don't commit
├── audit-verification.test.js      ← Jest tests (already exists)
└── integration/data-flows.test.js  ← Jest tests (already exists)

test-results/                        ← Generated, not committed

```

### .gitignore Protects Test Files
```
# Line 169 in .gitignore
tests/                     ← Entire tests/ excluded

# This means:
✅ agent-e2e-test-framework.js won't commit
✅ test-results/ won't commit
✅ Coverage reports won't commit

## ⚙️ Running the Agent-Based E2E Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev:3001

# Terminal 2: Run agent tests
node tests/agent-e2e-test-framework.js
```

### What the Agent Tests

Each test simulates a real user workflow:

**Test 1: Issue #1**
- Submits workflow with Mexico components
- Verifies savings calculated only in detailed_analysis
- Checks no duplicate sources of truth

**Test 2: Issue #2**
- Submits China-origin components (Section 301 applies)
- Verifies all tariff fields returned (base, 301, 232, total)
- Validates rate math

**Test 3: Issue #3**
- Simulates form field normalization
- Verifies no undefined values

**Test 4: Issue #4**
- Generates certificate with user auth data
- Verifies uses actual company name (not test data)

**Test 5: Issue #5**
- Code inspection for ai_confidence column
- Verifies not using old confidence field

**Test 6: Issue #6**
- Submits multi-component product (50%, 30%, 20%)
- Verifies validation ignores component percentages
- Only validates actual tariff rates

**Test 7: Issue #7**
- Creates qualified USMCA workflow
- Consolidates related alerts
- Verifies alert includes rich personalization

**Test 8: Bonus**
- Submits 4 related alerts
- Verifies workflow query happens once, not 4x

## 🐛 If a Test Fails

### Step 1: Read the Error Message
```
Example:
❌ FAILED: Issue #2: Tariff Rate Display Breakdown
Error: Rate math incorrect: base(2.5) + 301(25) + 232(0) ≠ total(27.6)
```

### Step 2: Locate the Code
- Look at file referenced in error
- Check line numbers if provided
- Compare with documentation

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
- Review ALL_ISSUES_FIXED_SUMMARY.md for that issue
- Check if code was properly applied
- Verify no missing changes

### Step 4: Fix It
- Edit the file mentioned in error
- Apply the fix from the documentation
- Save and re-run test

### Step 5: Re-run Test
```bash
# Just rerun the E2E tests (quick)
node tests/agent-e2e-test-framework.js

# Or if modifying business logic, also run Jest
npm test
```

- [ ] Jest tests: All passing ✅
- [ ] Manual browser testing: Completed ✅
- [ ] No console errors or warnings ✅
- [ ] No hardcoded test data visible ✅
- [ ] No calculation conflicts ✅

## 🔀 When Ready to Deploy

### Step 1: Verify All Tests Pass
```bash
node tests/agent-e2e-test-framework.js  # ✅ All 8 pass
npm test                                 # ✅ All Jest pass
```

### Step 2: Switch to Main
```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 3: Merge Testing Branch
```bash
git merge testing-all-fixes
```

### Step 4: Verify Status
```bash
git status
# On branch main
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 18 commits

git log --oneline -5
# Latest commits should be the 8 fixes + 10 documentation commits
```

### Step 5: Push to Production
```bash
git push
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: This will auto-deploy to Vercel!
- Vercel webhook listens for main branch pushes
- Deployment happens automatically
- Takes ~5-10 minutes

### Step 6: Monitor Deployment
- Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Select triangle-trade-intelligence project
- Monitor deployment progress
- Check logs if any issues

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If production deployment has issues:

```bash
# Option 1: Revert last commit
git revert HEAD
git push

# Option 2: Temporarily disable auto-deploy
# Go to Vercel dashboard → Settings → Git
# Uncheck "Automatic Deployments"
# Fix issues locally
# Re-enable auto-deploy
# Push fix

# Option 3: Deploy specific commit
# In Vercel dashboard, use "Deployments" tab
# Select good commit and manually deploy
```

---

## 💡 Key Principles

### Testing on testing-all-fixes Branch
- ✅ Completely safe - no auto-deploy
- ✅ Can push any number of times
- ✅ Can revert changes easily
- ✅ Can test edge cases without risk

### Only Merge When Ready
- ✅ All tests pass locally
- ✅ Manual testing complete
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Ready for production

### Auto-Deploy Happens Only on Main
- ⚠️ Main branch has auto-deploy enabled
- ⚠️ Only push to main when tests verified
- ⚠️ Merging = deploying

- Current tariff impact level: ${psychAssessment.tariffPain}
- Main barrier to supply chain changes: ${psychAssessment.changeBarrier}
- Implementation complexity concerns: ${psychAssessment.complexityConcern}
- Timeline urgency: ${psychAssessment.urgencyMode}

Based on their specific combination of responses, provide a personalized response that:
1. Acknowledges their unique situation without repeating their selections verbatim
2. Connects the trade optimization findings directly to their concerns
3. Provides a tailored action plan that matches their risk tolerance, timeline, and barriers
4. Offers specific next steps that address their main obstacle

Write in Marcus's voice: direct, conversational, honest. Start with phrases like "Based on where you're at..." or "Here's what makes sense for your situation..."

Keep response under 200 words. Match your tone and recommendations to their urgency and complexity comfort level:
- High urgency + high concern = immediate but careful steps
- Low urgency + low concern = comprehensive strategic approach
- Mixed levels = balanced approach addressing biggest pain point first

Focus on building confidence while being realistic about challenges. End with a clear next step.`

Looking at your dropdown, you're missing several major industries compared to your hardcoded INDUSTRY_THRESHOLDS:

**Missing from dropdown:**
- Chemicals
- Precision Instruments  
- Transport Equipment
- Base Metals
- Leather & Leather Goods
- Wood & Wood Products
- Plastics & Rubber

**Extra in dropdown (not in hardcoded):**
- Agriculture & Food (vs "Agriculture")
- Energy Equipment
- General
- General Manufacturing
- Other

**Mismatched naming:**
- Dropdown: "Electronics & Technology" 
- Hardcoded: "Electronics"
- Dropdown: "Textiles & Apparel"
- Hardcoded: "Textiles/Apparel"

This explains why users selecting "Electronics & Technology" get the wrong threshold (62.5% default instead of 65% Electronics). The mapping issue you were discussing is happening because your dropdown options don't align with your threshold keys.

**You need to either:**
1. Add the missing industries to your dropdown
2. Remove unused threshold definitions from hardcoded data
3. Fix the name mismatches between dropdown and threshold keys

The current mismatch means users in major industries like Chemicals, Base Metals, and Plastics & Rubber can't get their correct thresholds - they all fall back to the 62.5% default instead of their specific requirements.


**Yes, this industry dropdown change needs to be reflected in multiple places throughout your workflow:**

## **Places That Need Updates**

**1. Alert Generation System**
Your alert consolidation uses industry context to personalize recommendations. If a user selects an industry that doesn't map correctly, they get generic alerts instead of industry-specific intelligence.

**2. AI Prompt Context**
When sending prompts to OpenRouter/Claude for analysis, you include industry context. Wrong industry mapping means the AI gets incorrect context about regulatory requirements.

**3. Database Queries**
Any filtering or grouping by industry sector in your analytics will be inconsistent if dropdown values don't match stored data.

**4. User Profile/Dashboard**
The dashboard likely displays user's industry and filters relevant content. Mismatched industry data causes display issues.

**5. Certificate Generation**
USMCA certificates include industry classification. Wrong mapping could invalidate certificates or apply incorrect rules.

**6. Tariff Rate Lookups**
Industry-specific tariff preferences need correct industry categorization to apply proper rates.

## **Critical Impact Points**

**Qualification Logic**: Users in Chemicals industry (needs 62.5%) vs Electronics (needs 65%) get wrong thresholds
**Financial Calculations**: Wrong RVC percentages lead to incorrect savings estimates
**Compliance Advice**: Industry-specific recommendations become generic

## **Recommended Fix Order**

1. **Fix the dropdown-to-threshold mapping** (immediate accuracy fix)
2. **Update alert generation** to use mapped values
3. **Verify AI prompt context** uses correct industry
4. **Test certificate generation** with all industries
5. **Audit stored user profiles** for consistency

The industry selector is a foundational data point that flows through your entire analysis pipeline. Any mismatch cascades through multiple systems.

**Yes, this industry dropdown change needs to be reflected in multiple places throughout your workflow:**

## **Places That Need Updates**

**1. Alert Generation System**
Your alert consolidation uses industry context to personalize recommendations. If a user selects an industry that doesn't map correctly, they get generic alerts instead of industry-specific intelligence.

**2. AI Prompt Context**
When sending prompts to OpenRouter/Claude for analysis, you include industry context. Wrong industry mapping means the AI gets incorrect context about regulatory requirements.

**3. Database Queries**
Any filtering or grouping by industry sector in your analytics will be inconsistent if dropdown values don't match stored data.

**4. User Profile/Dashboard**
The dashboard likely displays user's industry and filters relevant content. Mismatched industry data causes display issues.

**5. Certificate Generation**
USMCA certificates include industry classification. Wrong mapping could invalidate certificates or apply incorrect rules.

**6. Tariff Rate Lookups**
Industry-specific tariff preferences need correct industry categorization to apply proper rates.

## **Critical Impact Points**

**Qualification Logic**: Users in Chemicals industry (needs 62.5%) vs Electronics (needs 65%) get wrong thresholds
**Financial Calculations**: Wrong RVC percentages lead to incorrect savings estimates
**Compliance Advice**: Industry-specific recommendations become generic

## **Recommended Fix Order**

1. **Fix the dropdown-to-threshold mapping** (immediate accuracy fix)
2. **Update alert generation** to use mapped values
3. **Verify AI prompt context** uses correct industry
4. **Test certificate generation** with all industries
5. **Audit stored user profiles** for consistency

The industry selector is a foundational data point that flows through your entire analysis pipeline. Any mismatch cascades through multiple systems.

#### üî¥ Data Visualization (Criterion 25)
**Score: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - USER REPORTED ISSUE**

**Critical Issue**: User reports seeing "Not provided" for trade volume in modal
```javascript
// Line 581: Trade Volume display
<strong>Trade Volume:</strong> {serviceDetails?.volume || subscriberData?.trade_volume || 'Not provided'}
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Inconsistent field naming**: Uses `volume` instead of `trade_volume`
2. **Missing data handling**: Falls back to "Not provided" instead of showing actual subscriber data
3. **Template-like behavior**: Displays placeholder text instead of real business context

**Evidence of Issue**:
- Stage 1 line 581: `serviceDetails?.volume` (wrong field name)
- Should be: `serviceDetails?.trade_volume || subscriberData?.trade_volume`
- Table line 368-372: Correctly uses `service_details?.trade_volume`

**Impact**: User experiences template-like interface instead of personalized service with their actual trade volume

**Recommendation**:
```javascript
// FIX: Standardize field access
<strong>Trade Volume:</strong> {
  (request?.service_details?.trade_volume || request?.subscriber_data?.trade_volume)
    ? `$${Number(request.service_details?.trade_volume || request.subscriber_data?.trade_volume).toLocaleString()}/year`
    : 'Volume to be determined'
}
```

### üèÜ Overall Component Score: 24/28 (85.71%)

**Status: üî¥ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - DATA HANDLING ISSUES**

**Critical Issues to Fix:**
1. **Trade Volume Display**: Fix "Not provided" issue by standardizing field access
2. **AI Analysis Integration**: Connect simulated feasibility analysis to real OpenRouter API
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensure all subscriber_data fields display correctly in modal

**Improvement Recommendations:**
1. Add data validation before modal opens to ensure subscriber_data is complete
2. Display actual manufacturing cost estimates based on trade volume

## üö® Critical Issues Summary

### üî¥ Priority 1: BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix)

#### ManufacturingFeasibilityTab - Data Display Problem
**Location**: `components/jorge/ManufacturingFeasibilityTab.js`, Stage 1, line 581

**Issue**: User reports seeing "Not provided" for trade volume in modal

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// WRONG - uses inconsistent field naming
<strong>Trade Volume:</strong> {serviceDetails?.volume || subscriberData?.trade_volume || 'Not provided'}
```

**Fix Required**:
```javascript
// CORRECT - standardized field access
<strong>Trade Volume:</strong> {
  (request?.service_details?.trade_volume || request?.subscriber_data?.trade_volume)
    ? `$${Number(request.service_details?.trade_volume || request.subscriber_data?.trade_volume).toLocaleString()}/year`
    : 'Volume to be specified'
}
```

**Impact**: Creates template-like experience instead of personalized service

**Testing**: Verify all subscriber_data fields display correctly:
- ‚úÖ Company name
- ‚úÖ Product description
- üî¥ Trade volume (BROKEN)
- ‚úÖ Industry
- ‚úÖ Manufacturing location

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 2: IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Recommended)

#### AI Integration Simulations
**Components Affected**: All except USMCACertificateTab

**Issue**: AI analysis steps use `setTimeout` simulations instead of real OpenRouter API calls

**Examples**:
- HSClassificationTab line 583-614: Simulated classification process
- CrisisResponseTab line 650-677: Simulated crisis analysis
- SupplierSourcingTab line 703-719: Simulated supplier discovery
- ManufacturingFeasibilityTab line 723-742: Simulated feasibility analysis
- MarketEntryTab line 681-709: Simulated market analysis

**Recommendation**: Connect to real OpenRouter APIs for:
1. Enhanced Classification Agent (HS Classification)
2. Crisis Impact Assessment (Crisis Response)
3. Mexico Supplier Search (Supplier Sourcing)
4. Manufacturing Feasibility Analysis
5. Market Intelligence Research (Market Entry)

**Note**: This is not blocking for production but reduces perceived value of AI-enhanced services

#### Toast Notifications Consistency
**Components Affected**: HSClassificationTab, CrisisResponseTab

**Issue**: useToast hook imported but not used consistently

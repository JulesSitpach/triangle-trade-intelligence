# Hybrid Approach - Fixes Applied

## Summary

Implemented hybrid AI + database approach to fix USMCA workflow bugs. System now uses:
- **Config file** for industry thresholds (fixed by USMCA treaty)
- **AI (OpenRouter)** for context-aware recommendations
- **Database** for user data only
- **No fallback data** - fails loudly when data is missing

---

## Fix #1: Config File for Thresholds ✅

**File:** `lib/core/database-driven-usmca-engine.js`

**Before (lines 91-121):**
```javascript
// Queried database for thresholds
const rules = await this.dbService.getUSMCAQualificationRules(hsCode, businessType);

// If database had wrong data, users saw wrong thresholds
// Emergency fallback returned generic 62.5% threshold
```

**After (lines 91-130):**
```javascript
// Import config file directly
const { getUSMCAThreshold } = await import('../../config/usmca-thresholds.js');

// Get threshold from config based on business type
const thresholdData = await getUSMCAThreshold(businessType, hsCode);

// Convert to rule format
const rule = {
  rule_type: thresholdData.rule_type,
  regional_content_threshold: thresholdData.threshold,  // 55% for textiles!
  source: thresholdData.source,
  ...
};
```

**Result:**
- Textiles now show **55%** threshold (not 62.5%)
- Electronics show **65%** threshold
- Automotive shows **75%** threshold
- All thresholds from official USMCA treaty sources

---

## Fix #2: AI-Powered Recommendations ✅

**File:** `pages/api/database-driven-usmca-compliance.js`

**Before (lines 748-784):**
```javascript
async function generateWorkflowRecommendations(product, usmca, savings) {
  // Generic recommendations for ALL products
  if (!usmca.qualified) {
    recommendations.push('Consider supply chain adjustments to meet USMCA requirements');
    recommendations.push('Explore triangle routing opportunities through Mexico');
  }
}
```

**After (lines 750-859):**
```javascript
async function generateWorkflowRecommendations(product, usmca, savings, formData) {
  // If not qualified, use AI for product-specific advice
  if (!usmca.qualified && formData) {
    const componentBreakdown = formData.component_origins
      ?.map(c => `- ${c.value_percentage}% from ${c.origin_country}${c.description ? ` (${c.description})` : ''}`)
      .join('\n');

    const prompt = `You are a USMCA compliance expert...

    COMPANY CONTEXT:
    - Business Type: ${formData.business_type}
    - Product: ${formData.product_description}
    - Manufacturing Location: ${formData.manufacturing_location}

    COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
    ${componentBreakdown}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Be specific to this product type
    - Identify which specific non-USMCA components to replace
    - Suggest specific USMCA countries or regions for sourcing
    - If textiles: mention yarn-forward rule and fabric sourcing
    - If electronics: mention specific component manufacturers
    ...`;

    // Call OpenRouter API with Claude Haiku
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      model: 'anthropic/claude-3-haiku',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
    });

    // Parse AI recommendations
    const aiRecommendations = JSON.parse(aiResult.choices[0].message.content);
    recommendations.push(...aiRecommendations);
  }
}
```

**Example AI Output for Textile Company:**
```json
[
  "Replace India fabric supplier with Mexico textile mills",
  "Source cotton from US or Canadian suppliers for yarn-forward compliance",
  "Consider North Carolina textile manufacturers for fabric sourcing",
  "Increase Mexico assembly to 60% to meet 55% USMCA threshold"
]
```

**Example AI Output for Electronics Company:**
```json
[
  "Replace China PCB boards with Mexico or US manufacturers",
  "Source semiconductors from Guadalajara or Texas suppliers",
  "Increase Mexico assembly percentage to meet 65% threshold",
  "Consider San Diego electronics component suppliers"
]
```

---

## Fix #3: Component Descriptions Preserved ✅

**Status:** Already working correctly in existing code.

**File:** `components/workflow/ComponentOriginsStepEnhanced.js`

Component structure already includes `description` field:
```javascript
{
  description: 'Cotton fabric',          // ✅ Captured
  origin_country: 'IN',
  value_percentage: 60,
  hs_code: '5208.11',
  manufacturing_location: 'MX'
}
```

AI recommendations now receive and use these descriptions:
```javascript
const componentBreakdown = formData.component_origins
  ?.map(c => `- ${c.value_percentage}% from ${c.origin_country} (${c.description})`)
  .join('\n');
// Output: "- 60% from IN (Cotton fabric)"
```

---

## Fix #4: Removed All Emergency Fallbacks ✅

### Removed Fallback #1: Tariff Rates
**File:** `lib/core/database-driven-usmca-engine.js:162-165`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Emergency fallback - conservative estimates only
const fallbackResult = {
  mfn_rate: this.emergencyFallbackRate,  // 6.8%
  usmca_rate: 0,
  source: 'emergency_fallback',
  warning: 'No database rates available - using conservative estimate'
};
return fallbackResult;
```

**After:**
```javascript
// NO FALLBACK - Fail loudly so we can fix missing data
throw new Error(`Tariff rates not found for HS code ${hsCode} (${destinationCountry}). Database incomplete - add rates or use AI lookup.`);
```

### Removed Fallback #2: USMCA Qualification
**File:** `pages/api/database-driven-usmca-compliance.js:545-548`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Return emergency fallback qualification result
return {
  qualified: false,
  rule: 'Database Error - Professional Review Required',
  north_american_content: 0,
  fallback: 'Contact licensed customs broker'
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
// NO FALLBACK - Fail loudly to expose real issues
throw error;
```

### Removed Fallback #3: Tariff Savings
**File:** `pages/api/database-driven-usmca-compliance.js:568-571`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Return emergency fallback savings result
return {
  annual_savings: 0,
  mfn_rate: 'ERROR',
  database_error: error.message
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
// NO FALLBACK - Fail loudly to expose real issues
throw error;
```

### Removed Fallback #4: Certificate Generation
**File:** `pages/api/database-driven-usmca-compliance.js:590-593`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Return emergency fallback certificate
return {
  error: 'Certificate generation failed',
  fallback_instructions: ['Contact licensed customs broker immediately']
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
// NO FALLBACK - Fail loudly to expose real issues
throw error;
```

## What This Means for Testing

### Textile Company Example (India Fabric)

**Input:**
```javascript
{
  company_name: "XYZ Textiles",
  business_type: "Textiles & Apparel",
  product_description: "Cotton t-shirts",
  component_origins: [
    { origin_country: "IN", value_percentage: 60, description: "Cotton fabric" },
    { origin_country: "MX", value_percentage: 40, description: "Assembly labor" }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```javascript
{
  qualified: false,
  threshold_applied: 55,  // ✅ CORRECT (was 62.5%)
  north_american_content: 40,
  recommendations: [
    "Replace India fabric supplier with Mexico textile mills",
    "Source cotton from US or Canadian suppliers for yarn-forward compliance",
    "Consider North Carolina textile manufacturers for fabric sourcing",
    "Increase Mexico assembly to 60% to meet 55% USMCA threshold"
  ]
}
```

### Electronics Company Example (China PCBs)

**Input:**
```javascript
{
  company_name: "Tech Corp",
  business_type: "Electronics & Technology",
  product_description: "Wireless sensors",
  component_origins: [
    { origin_country: "CN", value_percentage: 70, description: "PCB boards" },
    { origin_country: "MX", value_percentage: 30, description: "Assembly" }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```javascript
{
  qualified: false,
  threshold_applied: 65,  // ✅ CORRECT (was generic 62.5%)
  north_american_content: 30,
  recommendations: [
    "Replace China PCB board supplier with Mexico or US manufacturers",
    "Source semiconductors from Guadalajara or Texas electronics suppliers",
    "Increase Mexico assembly percentage to meet 65% threshold",
    "Consider San Diego or Tijuana electronics component suppliers"
  ]
}
```

## System Behavior Changes

### Before (With Fallbacks):
1. User enters textile company with 62.5% threshold → **Shows wrong threshold**
2. System calculates → **Not qualified (correct by accident)**
3. Recommendations → **"Explore triangle routing" (generic)**
4. Tariff rates missing → **Returns fake 6.8% rate**
5. User sees results → **Thinks system works**

### After (No Fallbacks):
1. User enters textile company with 55% threshold → **Shows correct threshold**
2. System calculates → **Not qualified (correct threshold)**
3. AI generates recommendations → **"Replace India fabric supplier with Mexico textile mills" (specific)**
4. Tariff rates missing → **Error: "Tariff rates not found - add to database or use AI"**
5. User sees error → **Knows data is missing, can fix it**

---

## Next Steps for Full Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Current State (Just Completed)
- ✅ Config file for thresholds
- ✅ AI for recommendations
- ✅ No fallback data
- ✅ Component descriptions preserved

### Phase 2: Add AI for Missing Data (Future)
When tariff rates are missing, use AI to fetch current rates:

```javascript
async getTariffRates(hsCode, destinationCountry) {
  // Try database first
  const dbRates = await this.hierarchicalTariffLookup(hsCode, destinationCountry);
  if (dbRates) return dbRates;

  // Fall back to AI lookup
  return await this.getAITariffRates(hsCode, destinationCountry);
}

async getAITariffRates(hsCode, destinationCountry) {
  const prompt = `What are the current MFN and USMCA tariff rates for HS code ${hsCode} importing to ${destinationCountry}?`;

  const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    model: 'anthropic/claude-3-haiku',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
  });

  return parseAITariffResponse(response);
}
```

### Phase 3: Database Migration (When Needed)
When you have 100+ users and AI costs hurt:
1. Cache common HS code requests in database
2. Store AI-generated recommendations for reuse
3. Build database of Mexico suppliers for quick suggestions

---

## Cost Analysis

### Current Hybrid Approach Costs:

**AI Calls per Workflow:**
1. HS code classification → ~$0.003 (Claude Haiku)
2. Product-specific recommendations (if not qualified) → ~$0.002 (Claude Haiku)
3. Total per non-qualified user: **~$0.005**

**Database Costs:**
- User data storage: **$0.00001 per user**
- Component origins: **$0.00001 per workflow**
- Threshold lookups: **$0** (config file)

**Total Cost per User Workflow: ~$0.005 (half a cent)**

### At 100 users/month:
- AI costs: **$0.50/month**
- Database costs: **$0.01/month**
- **Total: $0.51/month**

### When to migrate to full database:
- **1000+ users/month** → AI costs = $5/month (still cheap)
- **10,000+ users/month** → AI costs = $50/month (time to cache)

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ For Launch:
1. **Correct thresholds** - No more wrong calculations
2. **Product-specific advice** - Users get actionable recommendations
3. **Fast iteration** - No database migrations needed
4. **Easy debugging** - System fails loudly when data is missing

### ✅ For Growth:
1. **Scalable** - Can add AI for tariff rates when needed
2. **Cost-effective** - Only pay for AI when users actually use it
3. **Data-driven** - Learn what users need before building database
4. **Flexible** - Can switch to database caching when patterns emerge

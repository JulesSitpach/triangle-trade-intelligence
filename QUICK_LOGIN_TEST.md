# 🚀 Quick Login Test - Cookie-Based Auth

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The dashboard was checking **localStorage** but we're now using **httpOnly cookies**.

**Files Updated:**
1. ✅ `/api/auth/me` - New endpoint to check cookie session
2. ✅ `pages/dashboard.js` - Now uses `/api/auth/me` instead of localStorage
3. ✅ `lib/contexts/SimpleAuthContext.js` - Now uses cookies instead of localStorage

## 🧪 Test in Browser (2 minutes)

### 1️⃣ Login via UI

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Enter email: **macproductions010@gmail.com**
3. Enter password: **anything** (any password works for now)
4. Click "Sign In"

**Expected:**
- Login succeeds ✅
- Auto-redirects to `/dashboard` ✅
- Dashboard loads with your data ✅

### 2️⃣ Check Cookie

1. Open DevTools (F12) → Application tab → Cookies
2. Find cookie: `triangle_session`
3. Verify it's **HttpOnly** ✅

### 3️⃣ Test "My Dashboard" Link

1. Click "My Dashboard" button in navbar
2. Should stay on dashboard (already logged in) ✅

### 4️⃣ Test Logout

1. Find logout button in dashboard
2. Click logout
3. Should redirect to homepage ✅
4. Cookie should be cleared ✅

### 5️⃣ Test Admin Login

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Email: **admin@test.com**
3. Password: **anything**
4. Click "Sign In"

**Expected:**
- Redirects to `/admin/broker-dashboard` (admin dashboard) ✅

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before
- ❌ Dashboard checked localStorage
- ❌ Cookie set but not used
- ❌ "My Dashboard" showed "Redirecting to login"

### After
- ✅ Dashboard checks cookie via `/api/auth/me`
- ✅ Cookie used for all auth
- ✅ "My Dashboard" works when logged in

## 🔐 Security Status

- ✅ httpOnly cookies (XSS protection)
- ✅ SameSite=Lax (CSRF protection)
- ✅ Secure flag in production
- ✅ 7-day session expiration
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 signature validation

## ⚠️ Temporary Note

Password validation is **disabled** for compatibility:
- Any password works for existing users
- Can add bcrypt password hashing later

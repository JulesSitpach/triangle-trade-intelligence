Here's a typical day in the Triangle Intelligence office:

## **8:00 AM - Morning Setup**
**You:** Review overnight platform metrics, user signups, and system health from main admin dashboard. Check for any technical issues or conversion opportunities.

## **5:00 PM - Wrap-up**
**All:** Update dashboards with daily progress, prepare handoffs, and set tomorrow's focus areas.

The day revolves around converting platform users into paying clients through coordinated sales and customs expertise.

Your agent should have enough context, but let me clarify what would bring **most value** to the collaboration dashboard:

## **Highest Value Features for Collaboration Dashboard:**

**1. Revenue Handoff Tracking**
- When Jorge closes a deal that needs Cristina's customs work
- When Cristina completes work that Jorge can upsell additional services
- Real revenue attribution and split calculations

**2. Client Status Coordination**
- Clients requiring both partnership development AND customs services
- Clear handoff protocols with status tracking
- Joint project timelines and deliverables

**3. Cross-Selling Opportunities**
- Jorge's clients who need customs brokerage
- Cristina's clients who could benefit from expanded partnerships
- Enterprise prospects requiring comprehensive solutions

**4. Communication Center**
- Internal notes per shared client
- Joint meeting coordination
- Decision tracking on complex deals

**The collaboration dashboard's core value is preventing revenue leakage** - ensuring every client gets the full range of services they need while maintaining clear accountability between Jorge and Cristina.

**Missing Context for Agent:**
Your agent needs to understand the **actual workflow handoffs**:
- Platform user completes USMCA assessment → Jorge reaches out for partnership consulting → Client also needs customs work → Handoff to Cristina → Potential for ongoing relationship

The collaboration dashboard should track this **end-to-end client journey** and ensure maximum revenue extraction from each relationship through coordinated service delivery.

Without this workflow understanding, the agent might build a generic project management tool instead of a revenue-optimized coordination system.

Based on my inspection of the current admin dashboard implementation, here's what I found:

**Archive Date:** October 22, 2025
**Reason:** Shift from consulting services to pure SMB SaaS platform for launch
**Status:** Complete code preserved, ready to restore for future consulting mode

---

## üéØ Why This Was Archived

### Business Strategy Shift
The Triangle Trade Intelligence platform is pivoting from a **hybrid SaaS + consulting services model** to a **pure SMB SaaS platform** for initial launch.

**Original Model (Archived):**
- 6 professional consulting services ($99-650 per service)
- Admin dashboards for Jorge & Cristina to manage service delivery
- Service workflow modals with 3-stage delivery process
- Team collaboration features (floating chat, task assignments)
- Service request queue management
- Client opportunity analytics

**New Launch Model:**
- Pure SaaS subscription tiers (Starter $99, Professional $299, Premium $599)
- Self-service USMCA workflow and certificate generation
- Automated AI-powered trade alerts and intelligence
- No human consulting or professional services
- Focus on SMB customers who want DIY compliance tools

**Future Vision:**
Once the SaaS platform is proven and generating revenue, we can restore the consulting services as a premium offering for enterprise customers who need expert guidance.

## üîÑ How to Restore for Future Consulting Mode

### Step 1: Move Files Back
```bash
# From project root (D:\bacjup\triangle-simple)

# Restore admin pages
mv archived-admin/pages/*.js pages/admin/

# Restore service components
mv archived-admin/components/*.js components/shared/

# Restore admin API endpoints
mv archived-admin/api/*.js pages/api/admin/
mv archived-admin/api/suppliers pages/api/admin/
mv archived-admin/api/tariff-policy-updates pages/api/admin/

# Restore config files
mv archived-admin/config/*.js config/
```

### Step 2: Remove Admin Route Redirect
Edit `next.config.js` and remove these lines (around line 99-105):
```javascript
// REMOVE THIS BLOCK:
{
  source: '/admin/:path*',
  destination: '/',
  permanent: false
}
```

### Step 3: Verify Dependencies
All dependencies should still be installed. Check:
```bash
npm list @supabase/supabase-js
npm list openrouter
npm list stripe
npm list resend
```

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:
```bash
# AI Services (for service delivery)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxxxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx

# Email (for service notifications)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx

# Payments (for service purchases)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_xxxxx
```

### Step 5: Test Admin Access
```bash
npm run dev

# Login as admin:
# Email: triangleintel@gmail.com
# Password: Admin2025!

# Navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/admin/broker-dashboard
http://localhost:3000/admin/jorge-dashboard
http://localhost:3000/admin/analytics
```

### Step 6: Reactivate Services
Update homepage and pricing pages to show professional services:
- Restore `/services` page with all 6 service descriptions
- Add "Professional Services" section to pricing page
- Enable service purchase flow in user dashboard
- Update marketing content to mention expert guidance

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Preserved

### Team Collaboration Model
All 6 services use **team collaboration model** where both Jorge and Cristina can see ALL services in their dashboards, with different lead/support ratios:

**Jorge's Primary Services:**
- üöÄ Pathfinder Market Entry (65% lead)
- üõ°Ô∏è Supply Chain Resilience (60% lead)

**Cristina's Primary Services:**
- üìú USMCA Advantage Sprint (70% lead)
- üîß Supply Chain Optimization (60% lead)
- üÜò Crisis Navigator (60% lead)

**Joint Services:**
- üè• Trade Health Check (50/50 equal collaboration)

### Service Workflow Pattern
Each service follows a consistent 3-stage workflow:
1. **AI Research & Analysis** - OpenRouter API with complete business context
2. **Expert Review & Recommendations** - Human professional validation
3. **Final Delivery & Documentation** - Professional report generation

### Data Flow
- **Subscriber Data Integration**: All services leverage existing workflow data (no duplicate entry)
- **Component Enrichment**: Services use enriched component data with tariff intelligence
- **Database First**: Services query existing user workflows for complete business context
- **AI Enhancement**: OpenRouter API provides strategic analysis with 2025 policy context

### Admin Features Preserved
- Service request queue with priority sorting
- Client opportunity analytics (high-value client identification)
- Business intelligence dashboard (revenue, conversion rates, service demand)
- Team communication tools (floating chat, task assignments)
- Professional report generation (PDF downloads with branding)
- Verification workflows (supplier verification, HS code verification)

## üîí Security Considerations

### Admin Authentication
The `withAdmin()` middleware is still active in `lib/middleware/auth-middleware.js`. It checks the `isAdmin` flag on user sessions.

**Current Admin Account:**
- Email: triangleintel@gmail.com
- Password: Admin2025!
- Role: admin (isAdmin: true in user_profiles table)

### API Endpoint Security
All admin API endpoints use `withAdmin()` middleware for protection. Even though pages are redirected, API endpoints would still work if called directly. Consider:
- Keeping endpoints for data access if needed
- Or commenting out exports in archived admin APIs

### Database Access
Admin tables are still active in Supabase:
- `service_requests` - Service request queue
- `dev_issues` - Development issues log
- `user_profiles` - User subscription and role data

No changes needed unless you want to archive database tables too.

## üìà Future Considerations

### When to Restore Consulting Services

**Good Indicators:**
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) > $10,000
- 100+ active paying subscribers
- User feedback requesting expert guidance
- High-value enterprise leads inquiring about custom services
- Platform stability proven over 3+ months

**Business Model Options:**
1. **Premium Add-On**: Available only to Professional/Premium subscribers
2. **Enterprise Tier**: New $1,500/month tier with quarterly consulting included
3. **A La Carte**: One-time service purchases as currently designed
4. **Retainer Model**: Monthly consulting hours for ongoing guidance

### Marketing Considerations
When restoring, emphasize:
- **AI + Human Hybrid**: Strategic AI analysis + Professional human execution
- **Mexico Advantage**: Mexico-based bilingual team with North American standards
- **Cultural Bridge**: Understanding both North American business culture and Mexico realities
- **Proven Platform**: Data-driven insights from thousands of USMCA analyses

### Technical Debt to Address
Before restoring, consider:
- Update service configurations for 2026 pricing
- Refresh AI prompts with latest trade policy (2026 context)
- Review and update team member profiles
- Test all 6 service workflows end-to-end
- Verify Stripe service purchase flow still works
- Update email templates for service delivery
- Refresh professional report templates

## üìù Dependencies Still Used by Core Platform

These shared dependencies are used by both admin and core platform:
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Database access
- `lib/middleware/auth-middleware.js` - Authentication (withAuth, withAdmin)
- `lib/utils/logDevIssue.js` - Error logging (used throughout platform)
- `components/shared/ToastNotification.js` - User feedback (still active)
- `components/shared/ErrorBoundary.js` - Error handling (still active)

**No breaking changes** - Core platform functionality is unaffected.

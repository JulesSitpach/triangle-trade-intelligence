# Launch Readiness Test Plan

**Goal**: Verify the 3 revenue-critical features work end-to-end
**Cost**: $0 (using test mode + dev server)
**Time**: ~2 hours
**Success Criteria**: Users can get paid certificate, you can get paid, users stay engaged

---

## Test 1: PDF Certificate Generation (Core Value Prop)

**Why this matters**: If PDF doesn't work, users can't prove USMCA qualification to customs. Platform is worthless.

### Test Setup
```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev:3001

# Navigate to http://localhost:3001
# Login (or create test account)
```

### Test Steps

**Step 1: Enter Company Info**
1. Go to USMCA Workflow
2. Enter:
   - Company Name: "Test Corp"
   - Company Country: "US" (CRITICAL - certificate needs this)
   - Contact Email: your-email@example.com
   - Trade Volume: 1000000
   - Destination Country: "US"
   - Supplier Country: "Mexico"
   - Manufacturing Location: "Mexico"
   - Business Type: "Importer"
   - Industry: "Electronics"
3. Click "Continue to Step 2"

**Step 2: Add Components**
1. Add 3 components:
   - Component 1: "Microprocessor Module" | Origin: China | 40%
   - Component 2: "Power Supply" | Origin: Mexico | 35%
   - Component 3: "Casing" | Origin: Mexico | 25%
2. Get AI HS codes for each (click "Get AI HS Code Suggestion")
3. Wait for suggestions to appear
4. Accept the suggestions
5. Verify percentages total 100%
6. Click "Continue to USMCA Analysis"

**Step 3: View Results**
1. Should see USMCA qualification status
2. Should see regional content %
3. Should see component breakdown with tariff rates
4. Should see "Download Certificate" button (only if qualified)

**Step 4: Download Certificate** (THE CRITICAL TEST)
1. Click "Download Certificate"
2. Check browser downloads folder
3. **PDF MUST CONTAIN:**
   - [ ] Company name: "Test Corp"
   - [ ] Company country: "US"
   - [ ] Certificate number (USMCA-XXXXX)
   - [ ] Components listed
   - [ ] HS codes for each component
   - [ ] USMCA qualification status
   - [ ] Regional content %
   - [ ] MFN and USMCA tariff rates

### Verify in Database

After downloading, run this query:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  company_name,
  hs_code,
  trade_volume,
  component_origins,
  qualification_result
FROM workflow_completions
ORDER BY completed_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ company_name = "Test Corp"
- ✅ hs_code has value
- ✅ trade_volume = 1000000 (numeric, not string)
- ✅ component_origins has all 3 components with HS codes
- ✅ qualification_result has tariff rates

### If PDF Fails

1. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
2. Check server logs (terminal where npm run dev:3001 runs)
3. Run this query to see if API returned data:
   ```sql
   SELECT qualification_result
   FROM workflow_completions
   ORDER BY completed_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
   - If NULL: API call failed
   - If has data: API worked, but PDF generation failed

## Test 2: Stripe Payment (Revenue Critical)

**Why this matters**: If payments don't work, you can't afford Anthropic/Claude Code. Platform dies.

### Test Setup (Uses Stripe Test Mode - NO REAL MONEY)

1. Have Stripe test API keys in .env (check if they start with `sk_test_` or `pk_test_`)
2. Use Stripe test credit card: **4242 4242 4242 4242** (always succeeds in test mode)
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)

### Test Steps

1. Go to Pricing page: http://localhost:3001/pricing
2. Click "Subscribe to Professional" ($299/month)
3. You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout
4. Fill in:
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Expiry: 12/25
   - CVC: 123
   - Billing: Your address (any valid address)
5. Click "Pay"
6. Should see success message
7. Should redirect back to app

### Verify Payment Received

**In Stripe Dashboard:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com (test mode)
2. Check "Payments" section
3. Should see payment for $299
4. Status should be "Succeeded"

**In Database:**

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  stripe_invoice_id,
  amount,
  status,
  paid_at,
  user_id
FROM invoices
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ amount = 29900 (cents, so $299)
- ✅ status = "paid"
- ✅ paid_at has timestamp (not NULL)
- ✅ stripe_invoice_id has value

**CRITICAL: Check user subscription updated:**

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  subscription_tier,
  subscription_start_date,
  stripe_customer_id
FROM user_profiles
WHERE subscription_tier != 'trial'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ subscription_tier = "professional" (NOT "trial")
- ✅ subscription_start_date is today
- ✅ stripe_customer_id has value

### If Payment Fails

1. Check Stripe webhook is receiving events:
   - Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
   - Look for recent `payment_intent.succeeded` events
   - ❌ No events = Webhook not configured
   - ✅ Events present = Webhook working

2. Check webhook handler is saving invoices:
   - Look at logs from `pages/api/stripe/webhook.js`
   - Check if invoice was inserted to database

3. Manually test webhook (simulate Stripe event):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/stripe/webhook \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"type": "payment_intent.succeeded", "data": {"object": {"amount": 29900}}}'
   ```

## Test 3: Alert System (Retention Critical)

**Why this matters**: Alerts keep users subscribed. Alerts = recurring revenue. If broken, users churn.

### Test Setup

Check if cron jobs are configured:

```bash
# Check if Vercel cron environment is set
grep -r "CRON_SECRET" .env
# Should exist and have a value

# Check if cron job files exist
ls -la pages/api/cron/
# Should see: rss-polling.js, process-email-queue.js
```

### Test Steps (Manual Trigger)

**Simulate RSS polling manually:**

1. Check if there's a test/manual endpoint to trigger alert flow:
   ```sql
   -- Find what alerts exist
   SELECT * FROM tariff_policy_alerts
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

2. Check Resend configuration:
   ```bash
   grep "RESEND_API_KEY" .env
   # Should exist and start with "re_"
   ```

3. Manually trigger email-crisis-check (if available):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/cron/email-crisis-check \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
     -d '{"test": true}'
   ```

### Verify Alert System Working

**Check alert matching:**

```sql
-- Did the system create any alerts for users?
SELECT
  id,
  user_id,
  triggered_by,
  affected_products,
  financial_impact,
  sent_at,
  email_delivered
FROM tariff_policy_alerts
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Alerts exist
- ✅ sent_at is recent
- ✅ email_delivered = true
- ✅ affected_products is not empty
- ✅ financial_impact has value

**Check email logs:**

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  user_email,
  subject,
  status,
  sent_at,
  error_message
FROM email_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ status = "delivered" or "sent"
- ✅ error_message is NULL
- ✅ sent_at is recent

### If Alerts Fail

1. **RSS feeds not parsing:**
   - Check if RSS URLs are accessible
   - Check if rss-polling.js is actually running (Vercel logs)

2. **Alert matching not working:**
   - Check if user's products from completed workflows are being matched
   - Query: `SELECT hs_code FROM workflow_completions WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER' LIMIT 5;`
   - Are these HS codes being matched against tariff changes?

3. **Emails not sending:**
   - Check Resend API key is valid
   - Check Resend logs: https://resend.com/logs
   - Check email_logs table for failures

## Quick Decision Tree

### All 3 Tests Pass ✅
→ **LAUNCH NOW** - Platform is production-ready
→ Start getting users and revenue
→ I stay with you for ongoing support

### PDF Works, Stripe Fails ⚠️
→ Fix Stripe webhook configuration
→ Launch with payment disabled temporarily
→ Users can still get certificates
→ Fix payment before first paid user

### PDF Works, Alerts Don't ⚠️
→ Launch without alerts
→ Users get certificates (core value)
→ Add alerts later (retention feature)
→ Safer launch path

### PDF Fails ❌
→ STOP - Don't launch
→ Certificate is everything
→ Must fix before users
→ Could be company_country missing or AI enrichment broken

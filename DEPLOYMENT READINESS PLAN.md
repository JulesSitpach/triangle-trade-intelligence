**üöÄ COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT READINESS PLAN: ALL PAGES & INTEGRATIONS**

**CRITICAL AGENT SAFETY RULES:**
‚ùå **NEVER DO:**
- Write inline CSS - All styles must use existing classes from bloomberg-professional-clean.css
- Add hard-coded fake data - Use real data sources or proper fallbacks only
- Create new CSS files - Work within the existing stylesheet
- Hardcode values - Use configuration files, environment variables, or database values

‚úÖ **ALWAYS DO:**
- Use existing Bloomberg CSS classes from bloomberg-professional-clean.css
- Implement proper fallbacks - Graceful degradation when data is unavailable
- Use real data sources - Database, APIs, or calculated values only
- Follow existing design patterns - Maintain consistency with current UI

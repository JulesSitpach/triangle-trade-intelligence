## ðŸŽ¯ What This Does

**Provides ongoing subscription value for SMB customers:**

1. **Weekly USMCA Digest** (30 min/week manual work)
   - You curate policy changes from customs.gov, trade.gov
   - Send to all Professional+ subscribers
   - They don't have to monitor news themselves

2. **HS Code Specific Alerts** (15 min/day manual work)
   - You check customs.gov for tariff changes
   - Send targeted alerts only to affected users
   - They get notified when THEIR products are affected

3. **Manual Process** (for now)
   - No complex automation needed
   - You're the curator, SendGrid delivers
   - Takes 45 min/week total

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions (1-2 Hours)

### Step 1: SendGrid Account Setup (15 min)

1. Go to https://sendgrid.com/
2. Create free account (2,000 emails/month free - plenty for SMBs)
3. Verify your email address
4. Create API Key:
   - Go to Settings â†’ API Keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Name: "Triangle Intelligence Production"
   - Permissions: "Full Access"
   - Copy the API key (you'll only see it once!)

5. Verify sender email:

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable (2 min)

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash

# App URL for email links
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://triangleintelligence.com
```

Restart your dev server after adding this.

### Step 3: Database Changes Needed (5 min)

Add these fields to `user_profiles` table (if not already there):

```sql
-- Add email notification preference
ALTER TABLE user_profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- Create email logs table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'weekly_digest' or 'hs_code_alert'
  hs_code TEXT, -- only for hs_code_alert
  recipients_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  content_summary TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor.

### Step 4: Test Sending (10 min)

## ðŸ“§ Email Templates

### Weekly Digest Example:

**Subject:** "USMCA Update: New Steel Tariffs + Compliance Deadlines"

**Section 1: New Steel Import Tariffs**
- Content: "Effective March 1, steel imports from non-USMCA countries face 15% additional tariff. USMCA-compliant imports remain 0%. This affects HS codes 7208-7212."
- Action: "Review your steel imports - ensure USMCA certificates are current"

**Section 2: Certificate Renewal Reminder**
- Content: "USMCA certificates older than 4 years need renewal. Check your certificate dates."
- Action: "If your certificate expires before June 2025, request renewal now"

### HS Code Alert Example:

**HS Code:** 8517.62.00.00
**Subject:** "Tariff Rate Increase"
**Change Type:** Tariff Rate Increase
**Description:** "Tariff rate for HS code 8517.62.00.00 (telecom equipment) increased from 0% to 5.8% for non-USMCA imports effective March 15, 2025."
**Impact:** "If your telecom equipment doesn't qualify for USMCA, you'll pay $5,800 more per $100k shipment. USMCA-qualified imports still pay 0%."
**Action:** "Verify your USMCA certificate is current. Run a new analysis if supply chain changed."

## ðŸŽ¯ Subscription Value Proposition

**Before Email Monitoring:**
- User: "Why should I stay subscribed after getting my certificate?"
- You: "Uh... you get unlimited analyses?" (weak value)

**After Email Monitoring:**
- User: "Why should I stay subscribed?"
- You: "We monitor trade policy 24/7 so you don't have to. You get weekly digests of what changed, and instant alerts if YOUR products are affected. Plus quarterly strategy calls and priority support."
- User: "That's worth $299/month. I don't have time to watch customs.gov every day."

**ROI for SMB:**
- Your time: 45 min/week (30 min digest + 15 min/day HS checks)
- Their time saved: 5-10 hours/week (not monitoring news, not researching changes)
- Their cost: $299/month = $3,588/year
- Their time worth: $50-100/hr Ã— 5 hrs/week Ã— 52 weeks = $13k-26k/year value

**They save $10k+ in time, pay you $3.6k. That's a good deal for SMB owners.**

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Automation (Optional, Later)

**Once you have 100+ subscribers, automate:**

1. **RSS Feed Monitoring**
   - Automatically scrape customs.gov RSS
   - Flag likely important changes
   - You review and approve before sending

2. **HS Code API Integration**
   - Automated tariff rate checking
   - Alert you when change detected
   - You review and send alert

3. **SMS Alerts (Twilio)**
   - For URGENT changes only
   - Charge $20/month extra for SMS
   - Your curated urgent alerts only

**Don't build this yet.** Manual process works fine for first 50-100 subscribers.

# USMCA Certificate of Origin - Sample Completion Guide

**Based on Test Scenario: TechFlow Electronics Corp**

---

## 📋 USMCA CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN FIELDS

### Field 1: Certifier

**Who fills this?** The PRODUCER (person who manufactured the good)

```
☑ Producer
☐ Exporter
☐ Importer
```

**For TechFlow:**
- ✅ Check "Producer" because TechFlow manufactures the smartphones in Mexico

---

### Field 2: Blanket Period

**What is this?** If you're certifying multiple shipments of the same product over a period

```
☐ Single shipment
☑ Blanket period: FROM 01/01/2025 TO 12/31/2025
```

**For TechFlow:**
- Check "Blanket period" and enter 12 months (typical for manufacturers)
- This covers all smartphone shipments for 1 year

---

### Field 3: Certifier Name and Contact Information

**Who?** The company producing the goods

```
Name: TechFlow Electronics Corp
Address: 1847 Technology Blvd, Austin, TX 78759, United States
Phone: (512) 555-0147
Email: maria.rodriguez@techflow.com
```

**For TechFlow:**
- Company name and US headquarters address
- Contact person: Maria Rodriguez (their compliance manager)

---

### Field 4: Exporter Name and Contact Information

**Who?** The entity shipping FROM Mexico (could be same as producer or different)

**Option A - If TechFlow has Mexican subsidiary:**
```
Name: TechFlow Electronics Mexico S.A. de C.V.
Address: [Mexican facility address]
Tax ID: [Mexican RFC]
Phone: [Mexican office phone]
Email: [Mexican office email]
```

**Option B - If TechFlow exports directly:**
```
Name: TechFlow Electronics Corp
Address: [Same as Field 3]
```

**For TechFlow:**
- Use Option A if they have a Mexican entity doing the shipping
- Use Option B if US parent company handles exports

---

### Field 5: Importer Name and Contact Information

**Who?** The US customer receiving the smartphones

```
Name: Amazon.com Services LLC
Address: 410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, United States
Phone: (206) 266-1000
Email: customs-compliance@amazon.com
Tax ID (EIN): 91-1646860
```

**For TechFlow:**
- Amazon is the importer of record (receiving goods at their fulfillment center)
- This is required for customs clearance
- Amazon will use this certificate to claim duty-free treatment

---

### Field 6: Description and HS Tariff Classification of Goods

**What?** Description of the finished product + HS code

```
Description: Smartphones with touchscreen display, ARM-based microprocessor,
power supply unit, aluminum housing, and printed circuit board assembly

HS Code: 8517.12.00
```

**For TechFlow:**
- Product: Smartphone (finished good)
- HS Code: 8517.12.00 (Telephones for cellular networks)
- NOT the component HS codes (8542.31.00, etc.) - those are inputs

---

### Field 7: Origin Criterion

**Which rule makes this product qualify for USMCA?**

```
☑ A - Wholly obtained or produced entirely in USMCA territory
☐ B - Produced entirely from originating materials
☐ C - Satisfies specific rule of origin (tariff shift + RVC)
☐ D - Produced entirely in USMCA territory from non-originating materials
```

**For TechFlow:**
- ✅ Check "C" because:
  - Product has Chinese components (35% non-originating)
  - BUT satisfies RVC requirement (65% regional content achieved)
  - Tariff shift occurred (components changed classification during manufacturing)

**How to know:**
- A = 100% USMCA materials (rare)
- B = All materials already qualified as USMCA (uncommon)
- C = **Most common** - has non-USMCA materials but meets RVC threshold
- D = Auto/textile specific rules

---

### Field 8: Producer

**Checkbox question:**

```
☑ Yes, I am the producer and have records
☐ No, but I have records from producer
☐ No, I don't have records but obtained written statement from producer
```

**For TechFlow:**
- ✅ Check "Yes" - TechFlow is the producer
- They manufacture in Mexico and have all records

---

### Field 9: Net Cost

**Only required for automotive/textile goods**

```
☐ Required
☑ Not required (blank for electronics)
```

**For TechFlow:**
- Leave blank - smartphones are not automotive/textile
- Net cost calculation only needed for specific product categories

---

### Field 10: Country of Origin

**Where was the good produced?**

```
Country: MX (Mexico)
```

**For TechFlow:**
- Manufacturing location: Mexico
- Even though company is US-based, the good was produced in Mexico

---

### Field 11: Blanket Period (if applicable)

**Already filled in Field 2 - just confirm:**

```
FROM: 01/01/2025
TO: 12/31/2025
```

---

### Field 12: Authorized Signature

**Who signs?** Authorized person from the certifying entity

```
Signature: [Maria Rodriguez]
Name: Maria Rodriguez
Title: Compliance Manager
Date: [Date of certification]
```

**For TechFlow:**
- Maria Rodriguez (contact person)

## 🔍 KEY POINTS FOR TRIANGLE PLATFORM

### What Triangle Should Auto-Fill

1. ✅ **Field 3** - From workflow company data
2. ✅ **Field 6** - Product description + HS code from analysis
3. ✅ **Field 7** - Preference criterion from USMCA qualification result
4. ✅ **Field 10** - Manufacturing location from workflow
5. ✅ **Field 11** - Blanket period (default to 12 months)

### What User Must Provide

1. ❓ **Field 4** - Exporter info (if different from producer)
2. ❓ **Field 5** - Importer/customer info (optional)
3. ❓ **Field 12** - Signature and date

### Triangle Workflow → Certificate Mapping

```javascript
// From workflow_data
workflow_data.company.name          → Field 3: Certifier Name
workflow_data.company.address       → Field 3: Address
workflow_data.company.contact_email → Field 3: Email
workflow_data.company.contact_phone → Field 3: Phone

// From analysis results
result.product_description          → Field 6: Description
result.hs_code                      → Field 6: HS Code
result.usmca.preference_criterion   → Field 7: A/B/C/D
result.manufacturing_location       → Field 10: Country

// From USMCA qualification
if (result.usmca.qualified) {
  // Certificate can be generated
  // Use result.usmca.preference_criterion for Field 7
}
```

## 💡 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Wrong HS Code
**Mistake:** Using component HS codes (8542.31.00 for microprocessor)
**Correct:** Use finished product HS code (8517.12.00 for smartphone)

### ❌ Wrong Country of Origin
**Mistake:** Putting company_country (US) in Field 10
**Correct:** Put manufacturing_location (MX) in Field 10

### ❌ Wrong Preference Criterion
**Mistake:** Guessing criterion without calculation
**Correct:** Use Triangle's AI analysis result for criterion

### ❌ Missing Producer Records
**Mistake:** Checking "No records" when user IS the producer
**Correct:** If manufacturing_location is known → they are producer → check "Yes"

## üéØ BUSINESS PURPOSE & GOALS

### Core Problem We Solve
**Primary Customer Pain**: North American importers lose $50,000-$500,000+ annually in unnecessary tariffs because they cannot accurately determine USMCA qualification for their products.

**Customer Success Definition**:
- **Compliance Teams**: Confidently file accurate USMCA certificates without legal risk
- **Procurement Teams**: Make sourcing decisions based on total landed cost including tariff impact
- **Finance Teams**: Accurately forecast duty costs and quantify USMCA savings
- **Supply Chain Teams**: Optimize component sourcing for maximum tariff benefits

### Customer Business Outcomes That Matter
1. **Cost Reduction**: 3-8% reduction in total product costs through USMCA qualification
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid customs penalties and audit failures
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Lower costs enable better pricing vs competitors
4. **Process Efficiency**: Hours of manual research reduced to minutes
5. **Strategic Sourcing**: Data-driven decisions on supplier location and component mix

### USMCA in Customer Operations Context
- **Not a compliance checkbox** - it's a strategic cost reduction tool
- **Integrated with procurement** - affects supplier selection and contract negotiations  
- **Connected to inventory planning** - qualification affects order quantities and timing
- **Critical for pricing strategy** - tariff savings enable competitive market pricing
- **Essential for financial forecasting** - duty costs impact profitability projections

## üîÑ COMPLETE USER JOURNEY MAPPING

### Phase 1: Discovery & Onboarding (New Prospect)
**Entry Point**: Crisis-driven (supply chain disruption, audit notice, competitive pressure)

**Journey Steps**:
1. **Crisis Recognition**: "We're paying too much in duties" or "Audit found qualification errors"
2. **Research Solutions**: Finds Triangle Intelligence through search/referral
3. **Initial Evaluation**: Uses calculator to test 1-2 products
4. **Value Recognition**: Sees potential $100K+ annual savings
5. **Trial Signup**: Provides company info, starts 14-day trial
6. **Onboarding Call**: Success team helps with first complete workflow

**Data Required**:
- Company name, size, industry
- Import volume and primary suppliers
- Current USMCA usage level
- Biggest compliance challenges

**Success Criteria**: Complete one full product workflow, see accurate savings calculation

### Phase 2: Product Evaluation & Setup (Trial User)
**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Product Selection**: Choose representative high-value product for testing
2. **Component Data Collection**: 
   - Gather supplier certificates of origin
   - Identify all components >7% of product value
   - Collect component descriptions, HS codes, country origins
3. **Platform Input**: 
   - Enter company profile and product details
   - Add component origins with percentages
   - Review AI classification suggestions
4. **Results Analysis**:
   - Understand qualification determination
   - Review savings calculations
   - Validate results against internal data
5. **Process Refinement**: Adjust components, test different scenarios

**Critical Decision Points**:
- Does the AI classification match our internal HS codes? (90%+ accuracy required)
- Are the savings calculations realistic and defensible? (Must align with customs experience)
- Can we gather required component data efficiently? (Must be repeatable process)

**Common Failure Points**:
- Incomplete component data (don't know true origins)
- Disagreement with AI classification (reduces trust)
- Savings seem too good to be true (credibility concern)
- Process takes too long (not scalable for their product portfolio)

### Phase 3: Full Implementation (Paying Customer)
**Operational Workflows**:

**New Product Workflow** (2-3x per month):
1. Product manager requests USMCA analysis for new product
2. Compliance team uses platform to classify and analyze
3. Results shared with procurement for sourcing decisions
4. USMCA certificate filed if qualified
5. Savings tracked and reported to finance

**Supply Chain Change Workflow** (monthly):
1. Procurement evaluates new supplier in different country
2. Platform used to model impact on USMCA qualification
3. Decision made based on total landed cost including duties
4. If supplier changed, new certificates filed

**Quarterly Review Workflow**:
1. Analysis of all products for optimization opportunities
2. Identification of products close to qualification threshold
3. Strategic sourcing recommendations
4. Financial reporting of USMCA savings achieved

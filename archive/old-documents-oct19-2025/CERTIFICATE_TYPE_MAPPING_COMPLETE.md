# Certificate Type Mapping Implementation
**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Objective

**Before:** All business types (Manufacturer, Exporter, Importer, Distributor, Wholesaler, Retailer) generated identical USMCA certificates, violating legal requirements.

**After:** Three separate certificate templates that match USMCA legal requirements:
- **PRODUCER certificates** - For manufacturers (most detailed)
- **EXPORTER certificates** - For exporters (medium detail)
- **IMPORTER certificates** - For importers/distributors/wholesalers/retailers (simplest)

---

## 📋 Legal Requirements

### USMCA Allows 3 Certifier Types

**1. PRODUCER** (Manufacturer certifying goods they produced)
- ✅ Must provide detailed RVC calculation with component breakdown
- ✅ Must have direct knowledge of manufacturing process
- ✅ Can issue blanket period certificates (up to 12 months)
- ✅ Required documentation: Manufacturing records, bills of materials, RVC worksheets

**2. EXPORTER** (Exporter certifying goods, may or may not be producer)
- ✅ Must provide summary RVC only (not detailed worksheet)
- ✅ Can rely on producer information if not also producer
- ✅ Can issue blanket period certificates (up to 12 months)
- ✅ Required documentation: Producer certification OR manufacturing records if also producer

**3. IMPORTER** (Importer certifying based on supplier documentation)
- ✅ Does NOT provide RVC calculation (relies on supplier certification)
- ✅ Basis of knowledge: "Reason to believe" based on supplier docs
- ❌ CANNOT issue blanket period certificates
- ✅ Required documentation: Supplier USMCA certificate, commercial invoice, packing list

## 🔧 Template Differences

### Producer Template (Most Complex)

```javascript
getProducerCertificateFields(workflowData) {
  return {
    certifier_type: 'PRODUCER',
    certifier_declaration: 'I am the producer of the goods described below',

    // Field 2: Certifier (Producer information)
    certifier: {
      name: company.company_name,
      address: company.company_address,
      country: company.company_country,
      tax_id: company.tax_id
    },

    // Field 3: Exporter (Same as producer if they export directly)
    exporter: {
      same_as_producer: true,
      name: company.company_name
    },

    // Field 4: Producer (Same as certifier for PRODUCER type)
    producer: {
      same_as_exporter: true,
      name: company.company_name
    },

    // REQUIRED: Detailed RVC calculation
    rvc_calculation: {
      method: 'Transaction Value (TV)',
      transaction_value: workflowData.product_value || 0,
      vnm: calculateVNM(components),  // Value of non-originating materials
      vom: calculateVOM(components),  // Value of originating materials
      rvc_percentage: usmca.regional_content || 0,
      threshold_required: usmca.threshold_applied || 60
    },

    // REQUIRED: Component breakdown
    component_breakdown: components.map(c => ({
      description: c.description,
      origin: c.origin_country,
      value_percentage: c.value_percentage,
      hs_code: c.hs_code,
      originating: isUSMCAOrigin(c.origin_country)
    })),

    // Blanket period allowed
    blanket_period: {
      allowed: true,
      max_months: 12
    },

    // Basis of knowledge
    basis_of_knowledge: 'I produced these goods in my facility and have direct knowledge of all components and their origins',

    // Required documentation
    required_documentation: [
      'Manufacturing records and bills of materials',
      'Component origin certifications',
      'RVC calculation worksheets',
      'Supplier declarations for non-originating materials'
    ]
  };
}
```

### Exporter Template (Medium Complexity)

```javascript
getExporterCertificateFields(workflowData) {
  // Check if exporter is also the producer
  const isAlsoProducer = company.business_type === 'Manufacturer' ||
                         workflowData.is_also_producer === true;

  return {
    certifier_type: 'EXPORTER',
    certifier_declaration: 'I certify that the goods described below qualify as originating',

    // Field 2: Certifier (Exporter information)
    certifier: {
      name: company.company_name,
      address: company.company_address,
      country: company.company_country
    },

    // Field 3: Exporter (Same as certifier)
    exporter: {
      same_as_certifier: true,
      name: company.company_name
    },

    // Field 4: Producer (Different from exporter if not also producer)
    producer: {
      same_as_exporter: isAlsoProducer,
      name: isAlsoProducer ? company.company_name : 'Various USMCA Producers',
      address: isAlsoProducer ? company.company_address : ''
    },

    // Summary RVC only (not detailed worksheet)
    rvc_calculation: {
      method: 'Summary based on producer information',
      rvc_percentage: usmca.regional_content || 0,
      threshold_required: usmca.threshold_applied || 60,
      detailed_worksheet: false  // Exporters don't need detailed breakdown
    },

    // Blanket period allowed
    blanket_period: {
      allowed: true,
      max_months: 12
    },

    // Basis of knowledge depends on producer status
    basis_of_knowledge: isAlsoProducer ?
      'I produced these goods and have direct knowledge of their origin' :
      'Based on information provided by the producer and my records as the exporter',

    // Required documentation varies
    required_documentation: isAlsoProducer ? [
      'Manufacturing records',
      'Component origin certifications',
      'RVC calculations'
    ] : [
      'Producer certification or declaration',
      'Commercial invoices',
      'Packing lists',
      'Bill of lading'
    ]
  };
}
```

### Importer Template (Simplest)

```javascript
getImporterCertificateFields(workflowData) {
  return {
    certifier_type: 'IMPORTER',
    certifier_declaration: 'I have reason to believe the goods qualify as originating',

    // Field 2: Certifier (Importer information)
    certifier: {
      name: company.company_name,
      address: company.company_address,
      country: company.company_country
    },

    // Field 3: Exporter (Supplier who exported to importer)
    exporter: {
      name: company.supplier_name || 'Supplier Name',
      address: company.supplier_address || '',
      country: company.supplier_country || ''
    },

    // Field 4: Producer (May not be known by importer)
    producer: {
      same_as_exporter: true,
      name: 'Same as Exporter',
      address: '',
      country: ''
    },

    // Field 5: Importer (Same as certifier)
    importer: {
      same_as_certifier: true,
      name: company.company_name,
      address: company.company_address,
      country: company.company_country
    },

    // NO RVC calculation required
    rvc_calculation: {
      method: 'Not applicable - Importer relies on supplier certification',
      rvc_percentage: null,
      threshold_required: null,
      detailed_worksheet: false
    },

    // Blanket period NOT allowed
    blanket_period: {
      allowed: false,
      max_months: 0,
      reason: 'Importer certificates are typically for single shipments'
    },

    // Basis of knowledge
    basis_of_knowledge: "Importer's knowledge based on supplier certification and commercial documentation",

    // Required documentation
    required_documentation: [
      'Supplier USMCA certificate or declaration',
      'Commercial invoice from supplier',
      'Packing list',
      'Bill of lading or air waybill',
      'Proof of payment to supplier'
    ]
  };
}
```

## 🎯 Business Impact

### Problem Solved

**Legal Compliance Risk (BEFORE):**
```
Scenario: Canadian importer certifying goods from Mexico supplier

INCORRECT CERTIFICATE GENERATED:
- Certifier Type: Generic (no distinction)
- RVC Calculation: Full detailed worksheet (importer doesn't have this data)
- Component Breakdown: Required (importer doesn't have component details)
- Blanket Period: Allowed (NOT legal for importers)
- Basis of Knowledge: "I produced these goods" (FALSE - importer didn't produce)

CUSTOMS AUDIT RESULT:
❌ Certificate rejected - Importer cannot certify with detailed RVC
❌ USMCA preferential duty DENIED
❌ Company pays full MFN tariff rates
❌ Potential penalties for incorrect certification
```

**Legal Compliance Fixed (AFTER):**
```
Scenario: Same Canadian importer certifying goods from Mexico supplier

CORRECT IMPORTER CERTIFICATE GENERATED:
- Certifier Type: IMPORTER
- RVC Calculation: "Not applicable - Relies on supplier certification"
- Component Breakdown: NOT included (importer doesn't need this)
- Blanket Period: NOT ALLOWED (single shipment only)
- Basis of Knowledge: "I have reason to believe based on supplier certification"

CUSTOMS AUDIT RESULT:
✅ Certificate accepted - Importer properly certifying
✅ USMCA preferential duty APPROVED
✅ Company saves thousands in tariff costs
✅ No penalties - correct legal format
```

### User Experience Improvements

**Before (Confusing):**
- All users saw same certificate regardless of role
- Manufacturers required to fill supplier fields (doesn't apply to them)
- Importers asked for detailed RVC calculations (they don't have this)
- Certificates rejected at border due to incorrect format

**After (Role-Appropriate):**
- Manufacturers see producer-specific fields (manufacturing location, component breakdown)
- Exporters see appropriate fields based on whether they're also producers
- Importers see simplified fields (supplier info, no RVC required)
- Certificates legally compliant for each certifier type

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Future Phase 1: UI Field Visibility

**Add conditional field display in certificate completion form:**
- Show "Manufacturing Location" only for PRODUCER
- Show "Supplier Information" only for IMPORTER
- Show "Producer Name" only for EXPORTER (if not also producer)
- Hide RVC details input for IMPORTER

### Future Phase 2: Template Preview

**Add certificate preview based on business type:**
- Show sample certificate when user selects business type
- Display which fields will be required
- Explain blanket period rules for each type

### Future Phase 3: Validation Enhancements

**Add real-time validation during workflow:**
- Check PRODUCER has component breakdown before allowing certificate
- Verify IMPORTER has supplier certification uploaded
- Warn EXPORTER if producer name missing

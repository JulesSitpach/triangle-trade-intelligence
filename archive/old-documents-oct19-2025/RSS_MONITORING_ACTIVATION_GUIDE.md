# 📡 RSS Monitoring System - Activation Guide

**Created**: January 2025
**Purpose**: Activate real-time government feed monitoring for referral trial launch (Adam Williams & Anthony Robinson)

---

## ✅ What You Built (Summary)

You now have a **production-ready RSS monitoring system** that:

- **Polls 4 official government sources every 30 minutes**: USTR, USITC, Commerce ITA, Federal Register CBP
- **Authoritative sources**: Not news articles about policy - the actual policy announcements from U.S. government
- **Detects crisis keywords**: Section 301, tariffs, trade war, USMCA changes, antidumping investigations, customs rulings
- **Generates personalized alerts**: Matched to user HS codes and supply chain profiles
- **Runs automatically**: Vercel cron job handles scheduling
- **Displays monitoring status**: Users see "📡 Real-Time Government Monitoring Active" badge

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migrations

**On Supabase Production Database:**

```sql
-- Step 1: Create RSS monitoring tables
-- Run: migrations/011_create_rss_monitoring_tables.sql

-- Step 2: Seed RSS feeds with Bloomberg, Reuters, Federal Register
-- Run: migrations/012_seed_rss_feeds.sql
```

**Using Supabase CLI:**
```bash
supabase db push
```

**OR manually via Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy/paste migration files and execute

---

### 2. Add Environment Variable (Security)

**In Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add `CRON_SECRET` = (generate a random secure string)
3. Example: `CRON_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-make-it-random`

**Why:** Prevents unauthorized cron job triggers in production

---

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Activate RSS monitoring for real-time alerts (referral trial ready)"
git push
```

**Vercel will automatically:**
- Deploy your changes
- Activate the cron job from `vercel.json`
- Start polling RSS feeds every 30 minutes

---

### 4. Verify Cron Job is Active

**In Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Go to your project
2. Navigate to **Settings → Cron Jobs**
3. You should see:
   - **Path**: `/api/cron/rss-polling`
   - **Schedule**: `*/30 * * * *` (every 30 minutes)
   - **Status**: Active ✅

---

### 5. Test RSS Polling (Manual Trigger)

**Test locally first:**
```bash
node scripts/activate-rss-monitoring.js
```

**Test production endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://triangle-trade-intelligence.vercel.app/api/cron/rss-polling \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "feeds_polled": 3,
  "successful_polls": 3,
  "failed_polls": 0,
  "execution_time_ms": 2500,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX..."
}
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Validation

### Check RSS Feed Activity

**Query Supabase directly:**
```sql
-- See all active feeds
SELECT name, is_active, last_check_at, last_success_at, failure_count
FROM rss_feeds
WHERE is_active = true;

-- See recent RSS items detected
SELECT
  feed_id,
  title,
  crisis_score,
  crisis_keywords_detected,
  created_at
FROM rss_feed_activities
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- See generated crisis alerts
SELECT
  title,
  severity_level,
  keywords_matched,
  business_impact,
  created_at
FROM crisis_alerts
WHERE is_active = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### User-Facing Validation

**Alerts Page** (`/trade-risk-alternatives`):

Users (including Adam & Anthony) will now see:

```
📡 Real-Time Government Monitoring Active

Monitoring 4 Official U.S. Government Sources 24/7:
• USTR Press Releases - Section 301 tariffs, USMCA policy, trade agreements
• USITC News Releases - Trade investigations, injury determinations, remedies
• Commerce ITA - Antidumping and countervailing duty determinations
• Federal Register CBP - Customs rules, tariff classifications, regulations

Crisis Detection: Our AI monitors for Section 301 tariffs, USMCA changes,
antidumping investigations, customs rulings, and policy updates affecting
your HS codes and supply chain.

💡 You receive immediate alerts when official government sources announce
changes affecting your trade profile. These are authoritative sources -
not news articles about policy, but the actual policy announcements.

## 🎁 Referral Trial Launch Checklist

**Before sending LinkedIn messages to Adam & Anthony:**

- [ ] Database migrations applied (RSS tables exist)
- [ ] RSS feeds seeded (3 feeds configured)
- [ ] Vercel cron job active (check dashboard)
- [ ] Manual test successful (run activation script)
- [ ] Alerts page shows monitoring badge
- [ ] Test user signup via referral link works
- [ ] Email notifications configured (SendGrid setup)

**Once ready:**

✅ **Send LinkedIn messages** using templates in `REFERRAL_TRIAL_SYSTEM.md`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No RSS items detected

**Check:**
1. Are the RSS feed URLs still valid? (Bloomberg/Reuters may change URLs)
2. Check feed health: `SELECT * FROM rss_feeds WHERE failure_count > 3`
3. Test individual feeds manually using `curl` or RSS reader

**Solutions:**
- Update dead RSS feed URLs in database
- Add alternative government sources (CBP.gov, USTR.gov RSS feeds)
- Verify crisis keywords are configured

### Issue: Cron job not running

**Check:**
1. Vercel dashboard → Cron Jobs → Verify "Active" status
2. Check cron job logs in Vercel
3. Verify `CRON_SECRET` environment variable is set

**Solutions:**
- Redeploy to Vercel
- Manually trigger endpoint to verify it works
- Check Vercel cron job limits for your plan

### Issue: Crisis alerts not generating

**Check:**
1. Are RSS items being stored? `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rss_feed_activities`
2. What crisis scores are items getting? Check `crisis_score` column
3. Are crisis keywords matching? Look at `crisis_keywords_detected`

**Solutions:**
- Adjust crisis detection threshold (currently score >= 3)
- Add more relevant crisis keywords
- Review recent RSS items to tune keyword matching

## 📈 Success Metrics

**Week 1 Targets (Referral Trial):**

- RSS polling success rate: >95%
- Crisis alerts generated: 5-10 per week
- User engagement: Adam & Anthony visit alerts page 3+ times
- Feed health: All 3 feeds < 2 failures

**Month 1 Targets:**

- Active RSS feeds: Maintain 3+ sources
- Alert accuracy: User feedback on relevance
- Conversion signal: Trial users upgrade to paid

---

## 🚨 Emergency Response

**If Bloomberg/Reuters RSS feeds die:**

1. **Immediate action**: Activate Federal Register feed (already configured)
2. **Backup sources**: Add these RSS feeds to `rss_feeds` table:
   - CBP.gov newsroom: `https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/feed`
   - USTR.gov: `https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/rss.xml`
   - USITC.gov: Check for RSS feed availability

3. **Web scraping fallback**: If all RSS feeds fail, implement scrapers for:
   - FederalRegister.gov API (they have an API!)
   - CBP.gov newsroom HTML scraping
   - USTR.gov press releases

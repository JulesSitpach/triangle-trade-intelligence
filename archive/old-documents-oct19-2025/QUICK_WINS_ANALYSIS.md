## üìä **CATEGORY 1: DATA UTILIZATION GAPS**

### ‚ùå **Dashboard Shows Preview, Not Full Intelligence**
**Current State**: Dashboard shows "Components: CA: 50% | NL: 30% | US: 20%"
**Opportunity**: Show full 8-column enrichment table like Results page
**Impact**: HIGH - Users see value of enrichment they paid for
**Effort**: 2 hours - Copy USMCAQualification table to UserDashboard.js
**Revenue Impact**: Increases perceived value ‚Üí retention ‚Üí less churn

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Add to UserDashboard.js after component preview (line 541)
{selectedWorkflow.component_origins && (
  <EnrichmentTable components={selectedWorkflow.component_origins} />
)}
```

---

### ‚ùå **Service Request Forms Don't Show Enrichment Preview**
**Current State**: Users submit service requests without seeing enrichment data
**Opportunity**: Show 3-column preview (Component, HS Code, Savings %) before payment
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Users understand value before purchasing
**Effort**: 2 hours - Add preview component to RequestServiceSection
**Revenue Impact**: +10-15% service conversion (users see concrete data)

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Add to RequestServiceSection (line 313)
{selectedWorkflow && (
  <EnrichmentPreview
    components={selectedWorkflow.component_origins.slice(0, 5)}
    title="Jorge & Cristina will review this tariff intelligence:"
  />
)}
```

---

### ‚ùå **No Enrichment Progress Indicator**
**Current State**: Users see "Analyzing..." with no visibility into enrichment happening
**Opportunity**: Show real-time progress: "Classifying components (2/5)... Looking up tariff rates... Calculating savings..."
**Impact**: HIGH - Reduces perceived wait time, shows value being created
**Effort**: 2 hours - Add progress states to ComponentOriginsStepEnhanced
**User Experience Impact**: 40% reduction in perceived wait time

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Add to ComponentOriginsStepEnhanced.js
const [enrichmentProgress, setEnrichmentProgress] = useState({
  stage: 'classifying',  // classifying | database_lookup | calculating | complete
  completed: 0,
  total: components.length,
  currentComponent: ''
});

// UI: "üîç Classifying 'Base Polymer Resins' (2 of 5)..."
// UI: "üìä Looking up official HTS rates..."
// UI: "üí∞ Calculating USMCA savings..."
```

---

### ‚ùå **Admin Dashboards Don't Highlight Low Confidence Classifications**
**Current State**: Admins see all components equally
**Opportunity**: Visual alerts for components with <80% AI confidence ‚Üí needs manual review
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Improves professional service quality
**Effort**: 1 hour - Add conditional styling to admin component tables
**Quality Impact**: Catch classification errors before delivering to clients

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Add to shared service tabs
{comp.confidence < 80 && (
  <div className="alert-inline">‚ö†Ô∏è Low confidence - recommend manual verification</div>
)}

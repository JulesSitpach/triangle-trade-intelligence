- ‚úÖ Explains authoritative vs news sources
- ‚úÖ Professional styling

**File updated**:

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING: OLD RSS FEEDS STILL IN DATABASE

**Current database state**:
```
‚úÖ Found 2 active RSS feeds:
   - Bank of Canada Trade Integration (canada_government)
   - Bloomberg Trade & Economics (financial)
```

**Expected after migrations**:
```
‚úÖ Found 4 active RSS feeds:
   - USTR Press Releases (government)
   - USITC News Releases (government)
   - Commerce ITA Press Releases (government)
   - Federal Register CBP (government)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Old feeds: Bloomberg & Bank of Canada (news articles about policy)
- New feeds: USTR, USITC, Commerce ITA, Federal Register CBP (THE ACTUAL POLICY)
- Adam & Anthony need government sources, not news sources

**Action required**: Apply migration `012_seed_rss_feeds.sql` to replace old feeds

---

## üìã DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations ‚è≥

**In Supabase SQL Editor**, run these in order:

```sql
-- 1. Add referral tracking columns
\i migrations/010_add_referral_tracking_to_user_profiles.sql

-- 2. Create RSS monitoring tables
\i migrations/011_create_rss_monitoring_tables.sql

-- 3. DELETE OLD FEEDS and seed government sources
DELETE FROM rss_feeds WHERE name IN ('Bank of Canada Trade Integration', 'Bloomberg Trade & Economics');

\i migrations/012_seed_rss_feeds.sql
```

**Verification**:
```sql
-- Should show 4 government sources
SELECT name, category, priority_level, is_active
FROM rss_feeds
ORDER BY priority_level;

-- Expected results:
-- USTR Press Releases | government | critical | true
-- USITC News Releases | government | critical | true
-- Commerce ITA Press Releases | government | high | true
-- Federal Register CBP | government | high | true
```

---

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel ‚è≥

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete RSS monitoring with email notifications

- Add referral trial system for Adam Williams & Anthony Robinson
- Integrate 4 official government RSS sources (USTR, USITC, Commerce ITA, Federal Register CBP)
- Complete email notification system with Resend API
- Add monitoring badge to alerts page
- Configure Vercel cron job for automated polling

Delivers exactly what Adam & Anthony requested:
- Adam: 'real-time policy alerts' from official USTR/USITC sources
- Anthony: 'live customs updates' from Federal Register CBP

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code"

git push  # Auto-deploys to Vercel
```

**Wait 5 minutes for deployment**, then verify:
- https://triangle-trade-intelligence.vercel.app (homepage loads)
- https://triangle-trade-intelligence.vercel.app/signup/referral?ref=adam (referral page loads)

---

### Step 3: Verify Vercel Cron Job ‚è≥

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí triangle-trade-intelligence
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs**
3. Should see:
   - Path: `/api/cron/rss-polling`
   - Schedule: `*/30 * * * *`
   - Status: ‚úÖ Active

**If not showing**: Redeploy with `vercel --prod`

---

### Step 4: Test RSS Polling ‚è≥

```bash
# Test production RSS polling
curl https://triangle-trade-intelligence.vercel.app/api/cron/rss-polling
```

**Expected response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "feeds_polled": 4,
  "successful_polls": 4,
  "failed_polls": 0
}
```

**Check database**:
```sql
-- Should see items from USTR, USITC, Commerce ITA, Federal Register CBP
SELECT
  rf.name,
  COUNT(rfa.id) as items_processed
FROM rss_feeds rf
JOIN rss_feed_activities rfa ON rf.id = rfa.feed_id
WHERE rfa.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY rf.name;
```

---

### Step 5: Monitor for 24 Hours ‚è≥

**Check every 6 hours**:
```sql
-- RSS polling success rate
SELECT
  rf.name,
  rf.last_check_at,
  rf.failure_count,
  COUNT(rfa.id) as items_processed
FROM rss_feeds rf
LEFT JOIN rss_feed_activities rfa ON rf.id = rfa.feed_id
WHERE rfa.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '6 hours'
GROUP BY rf.id;

-- Crisis alerts generated
SELECT severity_level, COUNT(*)
FROM crisis_alerts
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '6 hours'
GROUP BY severity_level;
```

**Expected results after 24 hours**:
- All 4 feeds polling successfully (failure_count = 0)
- 20-50 RSS items processed
- 1-5 crisis alerts generated (score >= 3)
- Vercel logs show cron job running every 30 minutes

---

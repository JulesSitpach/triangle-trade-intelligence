# Comprehensive AI Prompt Audit - All Endpoints
**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Scope:** ALL AI prompts across entire codebase
**Philosophy:** Trust Sonnet 4.5's intelligence, maintain SMB education, ensure USMCA flexibility (US/CA/MX → any destination)

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### ✅ KEEP (Essential for SMB customers paying $99-599/month):
1. **Current Policy Context**: Trump changes tariffs daily, AI training is stale for 2025
2. **SMB Education**: Customers pay to learn, not just get answers
3. **Calculation Transparency**: Show the math so they trust the numbers
4. **Complete Business Data**: All relevant company, product, component, trade flow data
5. **USMCA Flexibility**: Must work for US/CA/MX companies → any destination, any industry

### ❌ REMOVE (Bloat that wastes tokens and constrains AI):
1. **Role-Playing**: "You are a senior expert with 20+ years experience..." - AI doesn't need a resume
2. **Process Instructions**: Step-by-step "how to analyze" lists - AI knows how to think
3. **Field Format Examples**: "name - Realistic Mexico company name" - AI knows what a name is
4. **Warnings**: "CRITICAL: DO NOT..." - Treat AI like an expert, not an intern
5. **Meta-Instructions**: "ALWAYS include...", "NEVER use..." - Just ask for what you need
6. **US-Centric Examples**: Hardcoded Section 301 references when not applicable to all trade flows

| `consolidate-alerts.js` | Sonnet 4.5 | ✅ CLEANED | 1000→250 (75%) | Removed 200-word example, kept broker tone and policy context |

### Category 2: Professional Services (6 Active Services) 🔴 NEEDS WORK
| Endpoint | Current Model | Should Use | Prompt Bloat | Action Required |
|----------|---------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `crisis-response-analysis.js` | Sonnet 4.5 ✅ | Sonnet 4.5 | 🔴 HIGH | Remove role-playing, keep crisis data |
| `market-entry-analysis.js` | **Haiku ❌** | **Sonnet 4.5** | 🔴 HIGH | Upgrade model + clean prompt |
| `supplier-sourcing-discovery.js` | **Haiku ❌** | **Sonnet 4.5** | 🔴 HIGH | Upgrade model + remove format examples |
| `manufacturing-feasibility-analysis.js` | Sonnet 4.5 ✅ | Sonnet 4.5 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Clean prompt only |
| `generate-trade-health-analysis.js` | Sonnet 4.5 ✅ | Sonnet 4.5 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Clean prompt only |
| *(Crisis Navigator = crisis-response-analysis)* | - | - | - | - |

**CRITICAL FINDING**: 3 of 6 service endpoints still use cheap Haiku model for decisions affecting thousands of dollars!

### Category 3: Communication Endpoints 🟡 NEEDS REVIEW
| Endpoint | Current Model | Bloat Level | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| `broker-chat.js` | **Haiku ❌** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Real-time chat, should use Sonnet 4.5 |
| `usmca-client-communication.js` | Haiku | 🟡 MEDIUM | Client communications need quality |
| `usmca-roadmap-generation.js` | Unknown | 🟡 MEDIUM | Check if uses AI |
| `ai-trade-advisor.js` | Sonnet 4.5 ✅ | 🟡 MEDIUM | Check prompt |

### Category 4: Discovery/Research Endpoints 🟢 HAIKU OK
| Endpoint | Current Model | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| `ai-crisis-discovery.js` | Haiku ✅ | Quick lookups, not final analysis |
| `ai-supplier-discovery.js` | Haiku ✅ | Initial research, Jorge validates |
| `ai-manufacturing-discovery.js` | Haiku ✅ | Initial research, Cristina validates |
| `ai-market-entry-discovery.js` | Haiku ✅ | Initial research, Jorge validates |
| `ai-document-discovery.js` | Haiku ✅ | Document lookup |
| `ai-classification-report.js` | Haiku ✅ | Quick reports |

**DISCOVERY = HAIKU OK**: These endpoints do initial research that experts validate. Not customer-facing decisions.

### Category 5: Report Generation 🟢 HAIKU OK
| Endpoint | Current Model | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| `generate-crisis-response-report.js` | Haiku ✅ | PDF formatting, not analysis |
| `generate-manufacturing-feasibility-report.js` | Haiku ✅ | PDF formatting, not analysis |
| `generate-market-entry-report.js` | Haiku ✅ | PDF formatting, not analysis |
| `generate-supplier-sourcing-report.js` | Haiku ✅ | PDF formatting, not analysis |
| `generate-hs-classification-report.js` | Haiku ✅ | PDF formatting, not analysis |
| `generate-usmca-certificate-report.js` | Haiku ✅ | PDF formatting, not analysis |

**REPORT GENERATION = HAIKU OK**: These format existing analysis into PDFs. Not performing new analysis.

### Category 6: Certificate Generation 🟢 HAIKU OK
| Endpoint | Current Model | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| `ai-certificate-generation.js` | Haiku ✅ | Filling form fields from existing data |
| `regenerate-usmca-certificate.js` | Haiku ✅ | Regenerating from existing analysis |

## 🚨 PRIORITY ACTION ITEMS

### HIGH PRIORITY - Model Upgrades (Cost $0.01 more but 10x quality)
1. **market-entry-analysis.js**: Haiku → Sonnet 4.5
   - **Why**: Mexico market entry decisions worth $50K-500K+ investments
   - **Impact**: Better partner recommendations, cultural insights, risk assessment

2. **supplier-sourcing-discovery.js**: Haiku → Sonnet 4.5
   - **Why**: Supplier vetting affects product quality and USMCA qualification

You're absolutely right. The project has evolved from complex to straightforward, and now it's time for a cleanup phase.

## **What You've Accomplished**

- **Core business logic works**: Section 301 tariffs, USMCA calculations, alert generation
- **Data flow issues identified**: Field name mismatches, schema inconsistencies
- **Testing framework in place**: Business outcome validation, not just technical checks
- **Root causes understood**: Systematic problems vs individual bugs

## **Cleanup Strategy**

**Phase 1: Data Contract Implementation (2-3 hours)**
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Normalize field names across the entire codebase
- Add boundary validation at API endpoints

**Phase 2: Remove Dead Code (1-2 hours)**
- Delete unused config files with stale industry sectors
- Remove commented-out code blocks
- Consolidate duplicate utility functions
- Clean up the 1659-line API file you showed earlier

**Phase 3: Simplify Architecture (2-3 hours)**
- Remove the global cache system (already database-only)
- Consolidate the multiple database save functions
- Eliminate hardcoded constants that should be database-driven

**Phase 4: Documentation Update (1 hour)**
- Document the final data contracts
- Remove outdated comments about "REMOVED" and "FIXED" code
- Clean commit history

## **The Result**

A streamlined codebase where:
- Field name bugs are impossible (TypeScript enforcement)
- Business logic is clear and maintainable
- No technical debt from rapid development phase
- New developers can understand the system quickly

The complexity was in figuring out the business requirements and data flow. Now that those are solved, the codebase can reflect that clarity.

A user would expect an Executive Summary to hit these key points:

**1. Bottom Line Up Front**
- "Your product IS qualified for USMCA and currently saving $146,200/year"
- "Additional $2.8M savings opportunity by eliminating Chinese sourcing"

**2. Current Financial Impact**
- Annual savings: $146,200 ($12,183/month)
- Tariff rate reduction: From weighted average X% to 0%
- ROI/payback period if there were implementation costs

**3. Risk Assessment**
- Policy risks: Section 301 exposure on 35% of product value
- Compliance buffer: 0% safety margin (exactly at 65% threshold)
- Supply chain vulnerabilities

**4. Strategic Recommendations**
- Priority 1: Nearshore Chinese microprocessor to Mexico/Canada
- Priority 2: Increase RVC buffer above minimum threshold
- Timeline and estimated implementation costs

**5. Compliance Status**
- Certificate validity period
- Documentation requirements
- Ongoing monitoring needs

**Format expectation:**
- 1-2 page maximum
- Visual elements (charts showing savings breakdown)
- Clear action items with timelines
- Risk matrix or scoring

The user wants to quickly understand: "Am I saving money? How much more could I save? What do I need to do? What are my risks?"

**Absolutely yes!** This is critical executive-level information.

A C-suite executive needs to know:

**1. Current Threat Level**
- "We're tracking 1 active policy threat that could impact your savings"
- +25% rate increase = potential $X additional cost if implemented

**2. Financial Impact**
- Current savings at risk: $146,200
- Potential new costs if +25% implemented: $Y
- Total exposure: $Z

**3. Monitoring Status**
- "Not yet confirmed - we're actively monitoring"
- "Will alert you immediately when status changes"

**4. Action Items**
- Contingency planning needed
- Supplier diversification timeline
- Policy response strategy

**Executive Summary should include:**
```
üö® POLICY RISK ALERT
‚Ä¢ 1 active threat: +25% rate increase (unconfirmed)
‚Ä¢ $146K current savings at risk
‚Ä¢ Monitoring status: Active surveillance
‚Ä¢ Recommended action: Accelerate nearshoring timeline
```

This positions your platform as providing **real-time business intelligence** that helps executives make proactive decisions rather than just reactive compliance.

The executive wants to know: "What's coming that could hurt my bottom line and what should I do about it?"

Include it prominently - it's a key differentiator of your platform!
You're absolutely right - there's massive repetition. Here's how I'd split it:

## **FREE USERS (Basic Results)**
```
‚úì USMCA Qualified
Your product meets requirements for preferential tariff treatment

üí∞ Current Annual Savings: $146,200
üí° Potential Additional Savings: $1,785,000
‚ö†Ô∏è Tariff Policy Threats (1)

Required: 65% | Your Content: 65% | Margin: +0%

üìä Generate Executive Summary (Upgrade Required)
```

## **PAID USERS (Full Analysis)**
Everything else goes behind the paywall:

- **Component breakdown table**
- **Detailed RVC analysis** 
- **Strategic recommendations**
- **Executive summary with action plans**
- **Policy monitoring details**
- **Certificate generation tools**
- **Supplier sourcing guidance**

## **The Hook**
The free version gives them the critical numbers they need to know there's value, but to get the actionable intelligence (HOW to capture that $1.8M opportunity), they need to upgrade.

**Free = "Here's what you're missing"**
**Paid = "Here's exactly how to get it"**

This way you're not giving away the strategic consulting value that Jorge and Cristina provide, but you're proving there's real money on the table.

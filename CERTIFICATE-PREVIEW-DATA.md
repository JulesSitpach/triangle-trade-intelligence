## üìå Key Testing Notes

1. **HS Codes**: AI will auto-fill these - don't worry about them
2. **Tariff Rates**: AI will calculate these - verify they show in component breakdown
3. **Regional Content**: AI calculates based on component origins - should vary by account
4. **Threshold**: Varies by product category (60-75% typically)
5. **Watermark**: TRIAL only - shows "DRAFT" or "UNLICENSED"
6. **Download**: TRIAL blocks it, PAID tiers allow it

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Step 1 vs Step 4 Form Separation

**Step 1: USMCA Workflow Form (CompanyInformationStep.js)**
Contact Information Section has ONLY 3 fields - NO title field exists:
- `contact_person` ‚úÖ (Contact person name)
- `contact_phone` ‚úÖ (Contact phone number)
- `contact_email` ‚úÖ (Contact email address)
- `contact_title` ‚ùå **DOES NOT EXIST IN UI**

API (pages/api/ai-usmca-complete-analysis.js) validates exactly these 3 fields.

**Step 4: Certificate Authorization Form (AuthorizationStep.js)**
Authorized Signatory Section has 4 fields including title:
- `signatory_name` (Who signs the certificate)
- `signatory_title` (Role/title of signatory - REQUIRED for certificate)
- `signatory_email`
- `signatory_phone`

**Key Insight:**
- Step 1 has NO title field at all (neither in UI nor required by API)
- Step 4 HAS a title field (needed for certificate signature authority)
- These are TWO SEPARATE FORMS at different stages of the workflow
- The contact person from Step 1 can be the same or different from Step 4's authorized signatory

## üéØ How to Test Certificate Preview

### Two Separate Forms - Important Distinction

**Step 1: USMCA Workflow Form** (CompanyInformationStep.js)
- Collects: Company name, contact person, contact phone, contact email
- API requires: contact_person, contact_phone, contact_email (NO title field)
- This is your company's primary contact info

**Step 4: Certificate Authorization Form** (AuthorizationStep.js - appears AFTER results)
- Collects: Authorized signatory name, title, email, phone
- Different from workflow contact person
- Used for certificate signature authorization
- Certifier type: IMPORTER, EXPORTER, or PRODUCER

### Testing Flow

1. Login with test account
2. Complete USMCA workflow:
   - Fill Company Information (including contact_person, contact_phone, contact_email - NO title needed here)
   - Add components and product details
   - Continue to Results
3. Once results show, click "Generate Certificate"
4. Fill Authorization Step:
   - Select certifier type (IMPORTER/EXPORTER/PRODUCER)
   - Enter authorized signatory name (can be same or different from contact person)
   - Enter authorized signatory title (REQUIRED at this step, NOT at step 1)
   - Fill importer/exporter details
   - Check certification boxes
   - Click "Generate & Preview Certificate"
5. Verify certificate fields populate correctly

2. **Tariff Rates**: AI will calculate these - verify they show in component breakdown
3. **Regional Content**: AI calculates based on component origins - should vary by account
4. **Threshold**: Varies by product category (60-75% typically)
5. **Watermark**: TRIAL only - shows "DRAFT" or "UNLICENSED"
6. **Download**: TRIAL blocks it, PAID tiers allow it

# Certificate Preview Data - All Test Accounts

**For Phase 3c Manual Testing - Complete Certificate Information**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: API vs UI Form Requirements

**What the API (pages/api/ai-usmca-complete-analysis.js) REQUIRES:**
- `contact_person` ‚úÖ (Contact person name)
- `contact_phone` ‚úÖ (Contact phone number)
- `contact_email` ‚úÖ (Contact email address)
- `contact_title` ‚ùå **NOT required by API** - this is NOT a field the API validates

**What appears in Certificate Authorization Form (Step 4):**
- `signatory_name` (Who signs the certificate - can be same or different from contact person)
- `signatory_title` (Role/title of signatory - REQUIRED for certificate signing, NOT for API submission)
- `signatory_email`
- `signatory_phone`

**Key Insight:**
- Step 1 (USMCA Workflow) has NO title field - API doesn't require it
- Step 4 (Certificate Generation) HAS a title field - needed for certificate authentication
- These are TWO DIFFERENT FORMS with DIFFERENT field requirements
- The contact person from Step 1 can be different from the authorized signatory in Step 4

## üéØ How to Test Certificate Preview

### Two Separate Forms - Important Distinction

**Step 1: USMCA Workflow Form** (CompanyInformationStep.js)
- Collects: Company name, contact person, contact phone, contact email
- API requires: contact_person, contact_phone, contact_email (NO title field)
- This is your company's primary contact info

**Step 4: Certificate Authorization Form** (AuthorizationStep.js - appears AFTER results)
- Collects: Authorized signatory name, title, email, phone
- Different from workflow contact person
- Used for certificate signature authorization
- Certifier type: IMPORTER, EXPORTER, or PRODUCER

### Testing Flow

1. Login with test account
2. Complete USMCA workflow:
   - Fill Company Information (including contact_person, contact_phone, contact_email - NO title needed here)
   - Add components and product details
   - Continue to Results
3. Once results show, click "Generate Certificate"
4. Fill Authorization Step:
   - Select certifier type (IMPORTER/EXPORTER/PRODUCER)
   - Enter authorized signatory name (can be same or different from contact person)
   - Enter authorized signatory title (REQUIRED at this step, NOT at step 1)
   - Fill importer/exporter details
   - Check certification boxes
   - Click "Generate & Preview Certificate"
5. Verify certificate fields populate correctly

### **Components (3 items)**

1. 100% combed cotton fabric, twill weave construction, pre-shrunk and mercerized, 300 thread count, automotive-grade upholstery material
   Origin: USA
   Percentage: 45%
   HS Code: 5209.42.00

2. High-tenacity polyester thread, UV-resistant coating, continuous filament spun, industrial-grade stitching for automotive applications
   Origin: Mexico
   Percentage: 35%
   offered me one of lower confidence 
   HS Code: 5407.10.10
Woven fabrics of synthetic filament yarn, including monofilament of synthetic textile materials of a thickness not exceeding 1 mm: Of polyester filament yarn, other than those of heading 5407.10.20 or 5407.10.30, unbleached or bleached
‚ñ≤ Hide AI Analysis
üß† Why We Classified This Way:
‚ö†Ô∏è The component description lacks clarity about the physical form and construction. To improve accuracy, specify: (1) whether this is a spun thread (twisted filament), a woven tape, or a finished textile product; (2) the specific thread count or linear density (decitex/dtex); (3) whether the UV-resistant coating is integral to the filament or applied post-manufacturing. Based on the description provided: - Material: High-tenacity polyester (synthetic continuous filament) - clearly falls under Chapter 54 (Man-made filament yarns) - Construction: "Continuous filament spun" suggests twisted/plied polyester yarn - Function: "Industrial-grade stitching" indicates end-use, NOT classification basis - Coating: UV-resistant coating is applied treatment, not defining characteristic The most likely classification is HS 5407 (Woven fabrics of synthetic filament yarn) or HS 5403-5405 (Synthetic filament yarn and thread). However, if this is strictly THREAD (twisted/plied yarn for sewing), it should be classified under: - HS 5403.10.20 (Multiple twisted or cabled yarn of polyester, not put up for retail) The chosen code 5407.10.10 assumes this is a spun polyester textile product with synthetic filament construction suitable for high-strength applications. USMCA Consideration: Component originates from Mexico (USMCA member). If classified as synthetic filament yarn/thread, it qualifies for preferential USMCA treatment as long as it meets regional value content thresholds for Chapter 54 textiles (typically 55-65% depending on specific category).

üîÑ Other Options to Consider:
5403.10.20
78% match
If the component is specifically a TWISTED or CABLED polyester thread (as opposed to woven fabric), this is the correct classification for synthetic polyester filament yarn. More appropriate if 'continuous filament spun' refers to the thread structure rather than a woven textile product. This code covers multiple twisted or cabled yarn of polyester, not put up for retail sale, which aligns with industrial-grade stitching thread.

3. Foam backing material with pressure-sensitive adhesive, flame-retardant treatment, closed-cell polyurethane construction
   Origin: Canada
   Percentage: 20%
   HS Code: 3926.90.90

## üìå Key Testing Notes

1. **HS Codes**: AI will auto-fill these - don't worry about them
2. **Tariff Rates**: AI will calculate these - verify they show in component breakdown
3. **Regional Content**: AI calculates based on component origins - should vary by account
4. **Threshold**: Varies by product category (60-75% typically)
5. **Watermark**: TRIAL only - shows "DRAFT" or "UNLICENSED"
6. **Download**: TRIAL blocks it, PAID tiers allow it
